[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:00:02}
Hello?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:04}
Hi, it's Kaitlin with America Works. How are you?

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:00:07}
Good, how are you? Did you have a good day?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:10}
I did, did you?

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:00:12}
Quiet.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:14}
quiet. No, that's not bad, though. That's a good thing.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:00:17}
Well, we had all these… Stupid rain… storm.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:22}
Oh.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:00:23}
Are never, ever gonna stop.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:26}
That's the worst.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:00:31}
What was it, the week before Christmas, we were in the 80s.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:35}
Oh, wow.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:00:37}
Yeah! And now, everything's soaked and blooded and… ugh.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:42}
Ugh.
That's tough.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:00:45}
Yeah, especially when we're, like, here, and we're spoiled. We don't get that.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:50}
Right, right.
Well, hopefully it'll dry out soon.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:00:57}
Well, it's supposed to… it's blue skies right now, but…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:01}
Oh, that's nice.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:01:02}
fall over again.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:06}
Oh, okay.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:01:07}
Yeah, that's what it's been doing lately, is it rained for, like, 3 days, then it stops, it's gorgeous out, and then it starts all over again.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:18}
Wow.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:01:19}
Yeah, pun, pun.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:21}
Lots of fun.
So, how is your job search going?

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:01:27}
I have been putting in quite a few applications, um, and what I've done is… Uh, like, uh, what do you call, um.
Two of them I've applied for before, and no.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:45}
forgot.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:01:47}
So, I actually reapplied, and kind of.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:51}
Good. I guess.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:01:52}
How do you want to say it?
my application.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:56}
Yeah, he tailored it more.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:01:59}
And…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:02:00}
10 years.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:02:00}
if I get anything. This is a little hard to keep going, I'm gonna admit.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:02:07}
Because…

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:02:08}
After, uh, I ended up not working anymore because of workman's comp and all this other garbage.
I tried to find other work.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:02:18}
Yeah.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:02:19}
I never got… I'm getting the same thing that I got then. Nothing.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:02:22}
Right, right.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:02:24}
And I think I kind of gave up after a while.
But I keep telling myself, well, you gotta keep trying, or you're not gonna get anything.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:02:33}
That's true. That's very true.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:02:39}
Uh, I've been using that, uh, what is it, AI thing? Uh-huh.
And, um, I found… I don't know if you've ever heard of this, but I'm gonna give it a shot.
what is it? Uh, AARP?
I've been getting, um, like, advertisements, emails, whatever you want to call it, for, um, them, and they actually have classes.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:03:11}
They have what? Okay, they have classes, yep.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:03:13}
Yeah, like those Allison ones. I haven't…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:03:15}
on one year.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:03:17}
But I'm thinking that I'm gonna give it a shot.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:03:22}
They don't great.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:03:23}
Anything.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:03:25}
That's good.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:03:27}
And so, I think I'm gonna give it a shot.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:03:31}
Excellent! I think that's a great idea.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:03:34}
And stuff, because it's specifically geared towards seniors.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:03:38}
Mm-hmm.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:03:39}
And so I thought, why not?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:03:43}
Yeah, absolutely. I think that's a great plan.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:03:47}
And, um, trying to think… I think that's pretty much what I've been doing. Like I said, I keep telling myself, when I apply for these different jobs.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:03:57}
I…

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:03:58}
Uh, if nothing else, I'm getting practice.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:04:02}
Right.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:04:03}
Absolutely. And there was, and I was just kind of looking for it this morning.
There's a job there on the 8th.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:04:12}
Oh, where?

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:04:13}
That's not… try to be fair, you know, with holidays and stuff.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:04:18}
Yeah.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:04:18}
But I think… I want gold whip.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:04:23}
Yeah, you should. There's reason… no reason not to.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:04:26}
Yeah, and… I'm trying to remember what it was for.
It's, you know, with Christmas and stuff, and then you find… stuff.
And it's like, now you gotta remember, what… what did I find?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:04:39}
Yeah. Yeah.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:04:41}
Although, I started kind of, like, um, taking notes.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:04:45}
That's good. Taking notes in your job search is really important. It can be very helpful, um, in making sure that, um.
You know, you… it makes it feel more concrete, you know? It feels more manageable. Yeah.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:05:02}
And it's more, uh, organized?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:05:06}
Absolutely.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:05:08}
And so, I've been taking notes, and what I'm gonna do is I… I've got my little notebook, and I'm gonna go through it and see if I can find that, because it was… Pretty good one. God, why can't I remember it all of a sudden?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:05:22}
Yeah, definitely find it in your… no, find it in your notebook. I think that's great, a great plan. Um…

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:05:28}
Have you ever heard of… one of the ones that I found, I think it might be this one. Uh, it's online. Mm-hmm.
How does that work?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:05:39}
We'll probably, with a webinar. They're all done a little differently. You know, when you register, it'll probably tell you, um, it'll outline the… who's gonna be there, maybe it's that you make up, like, one-on-one appointments with them.
The… for, you know, like, video call?

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:06:01}
Yeah, yeah, that was what was so unusual about it, is it was… and… but what I couldn't figure out is they had a listing of different jobs. Yep.
And, um, some of them… it didn't… it was a flyer that I got in the mail, in my email. Okay. And it was… some of them, I didn't know what they were.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:06:28}
Okay. And, and it… Could you look them up?

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:06:32}
I think I did. I think I did.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:06:34}
He has one or two.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:06:35}
Yeah, um, that was another thing that I was… I've been looking at, and it's… Uh… temp… like, temporary jobs.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:06:49}
Well, that's okay.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:06:50}
Yeah, and, um, they're a little… confusing.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:06:59}
How so?

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:07:00}
Well, that's what I was gonna ask. Okay, like, uh… I think it was Robert Hassel.
No.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:07:07}
No, no, no, no.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:07:08}
I'm sorry, it was the city, city of Hemet.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:07:12}
Okay.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:07:13}
They have different types of… Chem jobs.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:07:17}
Would you…

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:07:19}
Go in there, Um, it's… I'm running into… it's either remote, which is fine, but it's not… And, um… this, you know, like, it's not even in this state. And some of the jobs will say, must live in…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:07:39}
Yep. Some do, yep. It has to do with employment law.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:07:44}
Okay, if they don't say that.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:07:48}
The worst thing that happens is that, you know, that they do end up being something where you have to be there, but… You won't know unless you apply.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:07:58}
Okay. Okay.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:08:00}
You know? Unless they, you know, specify it in their Job application, you're not wasting anyone's time.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:08:08}
Phew, phew, phew.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:08:10}
You could send one.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:08:11}
uh… that's one of the… I think that's what that webinar was, is it was different temp agencies.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:08:20}
That's great!

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:08:21}
One thing that did make me hesitate…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:08:24}
Yeah. That's what I was waiting.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:08:25}
for here. Okay, uh, like, okay, for example, the city of Hemet has… Yeah?
A civilian investigator position.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:08:36}
Uh-huh.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:08:38}
Uh, police detectives with different things.
But it's a contract gap.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:08:45}
Yeah?

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:08:46}
And it's…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:08:48}
No, that makes it tough for reporting. If it's a… if you're not on their payroll, that can make… a, um… That can make reporting your wages difficult.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:09:01}
Yeah, and the other part of it was… is, like, okay, I think I remember I told you, I applied for, um, Walmart.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:09:12}
Yep. One of the things that…

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:09:15}
I… somebody else who did what I did, and she actually.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:09:20}
got into.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:09:21}
Walmart.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:09:22}
I'm not happy.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:09:23}
with it, and the reason Was, and this is what… I kind of hesitated on it again.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:09:31}
Huh.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:09:33}
I work, like, 4 or 5 hours a week. Or, excuse me, a day.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:09:39}
Okay.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:09:40}
And with this top 22 thing that they have here in California, I make about $20 an hour.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:09:47}
Mhm.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:09:49}
Um, Walmart is not paying that.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:09:51}
Mm-hmm.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:09:52}
And I found out like, when I did Target before, when they hired me, I worked there for a couple… two, three months, and I.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:10:03}
Yeah?

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:10:03}
Getting near about… Maybe 10 hours a month.
Which is not.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:10:15}
Right.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:10:16}
17 bucks an hour.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:10:18}
No, right.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:10:19}
Because it's gonna… my income.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:10:22}
Right.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:10:26}
And I'm like… Yeah… I don't think… if I even got called on that one, I don't think I would go too far with it.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:10:36}
it never hurts to go interview, you know, because it could be a different situation, it could be you could learn something that you didn't, you know, that you thought you knew, but maybe were… weren't correct about, you know? So I… I say.
Go, there's no reason not to.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:10:50}
Okay, well, they haven't… they didn't call, but the.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:10:54}
No, I'm just saying, though, like, in that situation, like, You know, if they do.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:11:00}
Yeah, because now I'm looking at… I've seen, like, jobs at, like, the gas station, and etc, and, um, they all seem to run into the same situation. Um, I thought… for one thing, I thought the minimum wage was higher than that, but they're paying, like, 16 and 17 bucks an hour.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:11:20}
Mhm.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:11:21}
And, um, I'm… and they're asking…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:11:25}
I mean, I don't know what it is in California. I do know that the, um, federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:11:34}
Yeah, but I… okay, um, I… have you heard of Top 22?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:11:40}
No.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:11:41}
Okay, what it is, it's kind of weird.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:11:44}
Okay.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:11:45}
It's changed… it happened about, uh, about 2-3 years ago.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:11:51}
Yeah. Okay, what the…

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:11:51}
What they did is, um, for somebody like me, an independent contractor, they ruled that you have to make at least 1.5 times minimum wage, or the company that you're working for has to reimburse you.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:12:11}
Okay.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:12:13}
Every other week, I get… Uh… what do you call, um, a stipend, I guess, or a reimbursement, whatever.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:12:22}
Everybody's called it.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:12:24}
So, I… like, if I only made, like, say, $15 an hour on that day, the company will pay me Uh, five and a half.
per set.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:12:38}
Right, and so that's different… so it's different than when you're an employee for a minimum wage, because you're… as a contractor, they're not giving you any benefits, you have to pay your own taxes, um, and so that's why, like, that would be why, um, they make them do that.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:12:55}
Exactly, because that was one of the things is, um, they, uh, they did that is because of the fact that I don't… I have Medicare, and um… and my supplement, but the only thing that the companies pay for is if, like, I have a car accident while I'm working.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:13:17}
Right, yep.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:13:19}
And that, um, and stuff, so that's why… that was another change that they made.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:13:25}
Mhm.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:13:26}
Oh, there was one other one, and that I… was… Curious what you heard about it, and if this affects me. Okay, evidently, one of the changes for taxes this year is that I don't get taxed on my kits.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:13:45}
Okay.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:13:46}
Does that affect my, um… oh, God, I can never remember the name of it. Social Security thing.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:13:57}
Well, I mean, you know, so they… so So Social Security is considering… they'll consider… they want to know your gross income and your net income. So, in theory, it could, because it would… Mean your gross income was higher, and your net income was higher.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:14:15}
Or not your gross income was higher, but your net income was higher. But with a 1099, they have their, like, own…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:14:22}
like, uh… Equation, you know, as far as what they… How they consider what you make.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:14:33}
That's what I was wondering, um, because it appears… Obviously, I make less in tips than I do, you know.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:14:43}
Right. For doing this.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:14:44}
And it appears, at least on a couple of mine.
I am not going to get even a 1099 for that.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:14:54}
Okay.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:14:55}
I make more than, um, what was it? $6.50.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:15:00}
Per year.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:15:01}
And on one, possibly two of them, I'm not gonna make that.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:15:07}
Okay.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:15:08}
And if I don't get a 1099 on that, do I have to even report that?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:15:14}
You have to report everything to Social Security.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:15:16}
How would I do that if… I'm not getting a 1099.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:15:23}
Remember, I've sent you this information about 4 different times. Um, you have to talk to Social Security. Um, let me resend it to you. There's a video, and there's an article, um, and you don't have to… No? Okay, because I was just going to say, you can make… you can make an appointment with Social Security, you let them know that you're working, you know, for these different companies, and then they will…
Help you, you know, they'll give you probably Um… they're gonna make, like, an estimate and base it on that. Um, so let me… are you sure you don't want me to resend it?

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:15:57}
Go ahead and resend it, yeah.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:15:58}
Okay, I'm almost.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:15:59}
Because now I'm… now that you said that, I'm like, I remember I watched that video.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:16:04}
Yeah.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:16:05}
I was looking for more information. I just couldn't get an appointment with Social Security.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:16:12}
I bet you can… I bet now… I bet you would be able to now, though.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:16:17}
You think so?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:16:18}
They do.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:16:19}
months ago, when I tried it.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:16:21}
Yeah, but they may have been, uh, it may have been during the government shutdown.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:16:25}
It was, like, right after it. Right… so…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:16:28}
So, but there was probably a backlog, right?

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:16:32}
oh yeah, I'm dealing with that on, um, a student loan issue. Yes, there is a backlog.
And that's a night… that was one of the reasons I called them, is because when I'm looking at my, um, previous year's, uh, incomes.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:16:49}
Even.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:16:49}
know I filed, and that's what generated that review that I got with Social Security.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:16:56}
Yeah. Um…

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:16:57}
It's still not showing me for 2023.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:17:00}
Oh.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:17:02}
And so, I've been trying to call them, and, um, you'll sit there on hold, as usual, for however long, and then all of a sudden.
It just hangs up on you.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:17:16}
Okay, well, I would try giving them a call again, um, and maybe try calling your local Office, if you're having a hard time getting through the national office.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:17:27}
So it wasn't… but that's… I was checking it. It's on federal, um, state has it.
But everyone doesn't, and that bothers me, although I did report it. I did report it when I did that review.
I did report 2023. I went all the way, actually, through the.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:17:48}
Right, I remember that.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:17:49}
Yeah.
So, um, but that kind of bothers me that that's still just sitting there.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:17:58}
He says…

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:17:59}
Um.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:18:00}
Yeah, so I would call them to follow up, just to make sure and say, you know, hey, this is what I'm seeing, this is what I submitted, and when I submitted it, um, I want to make sure I'm doing all the things that I'm supposed to, um… Yes. And then I just sent you the information, and it has some additional information that I may not have sent previously, because I just received it from, um.
In a document that my supervisor created. Um, and so there's additional information in it.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:18:28}
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah, send it the…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:18:31}
Go ahead.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:18:31}
and send that, because I did read that… It just… But there's more information in this that's… that has more info in the body of the email.
Good. That's… I would just.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:18:43}
I'm gonna say.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:18:44}
Because I don't know if I just didn't open and get it off.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:18:47}
Probably.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:18:47}
Open right, or whatever.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:18:49}
No, it was just that I… that… there was… I was giving you the information that Social Security was putting out there, um… And then… my boss made a more comprehensive document than Social Security, so I sent that information. I just didn't have it previously, and it wasn't because I didn't… it was that Social Security didn't have it, you know, posted that way, so… I was gonna say, yeah.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:19:16}
there was a blog on Social Security, and I went in to see if there was more information, and you pretty much did. You sent us the blog.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:19:27}
Okay, good. Okay, well, this is… this has more info, okay?

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:19:30}
That's what I want, yes, definitely from that.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:19:33}
Um, but I would reach out to Social Security about that discrepancy and it not being updated yet, so that, you know, you're doing your due diligence and saying, you know, I submitted this on this, you know, that, you know.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:19:44}
Yeah. On this date, or this month, and let them know, and say, you know, I understand there may be a backlog, but I want to make sure I'm doing everything I'm supposed to, you know?
Yeah, there's also another thing that I am going to do.
Uh, probably Monday. I'm just…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:19:59}
You can give it a shot.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:20:00}
Day after the holiday.
is I'm going to, um, there is a, um, uh, what do you call it? Like, uh, free assistance for people over 60.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:20:13}
Yep.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:20:13}
Catches, and…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:20:15}
Yeah, Vita.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:20:16}
I want to start doing mine correctly. You had told me last time.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:20:21}
Yeah. Oh, no.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:20:22}
No, no, no, you should be filing quarterly. And so, I want to get that cleaned up.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:20:28}
I'm making a.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:20:29}
appointment to go in with my taxes and figure out how I can fix this mess.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:20:35}
That sounds great. That sounds like a really good plan.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:20:39}
Yeah, I saw it on the IRS website, and…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:20:42}
Um, I'm.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:20:43}
And go in and try and fix it.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:20:45}
Perfect. Perfect.
Um, we have an upcoming webinar series. It's a gateway to call center jobs. Um… Which may also involve remote jobs, um, would you like to sign up for that?

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:21:01}
When is it?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:21:02}

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:21:11}
Problems!

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:21:15}
Oh, no, I'm sorry. Well, hopefully they'll offer it again.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:21:20}
I was just gonna say, or will they… there was one or two of them that you sent.
that, um… I got an email link, too.
And I went back.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:21:31}
So, those were the job leads, yep, that was the job lead session.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:21:37}
Okay, darn it. Because I… yeah, I think I went back in and looked at another I missed, and, um, it wasn't there.
Are you still there?
Looks like she is. Hello?
What happened?
Hello?
Are you back?
Oh, I know what's going on.

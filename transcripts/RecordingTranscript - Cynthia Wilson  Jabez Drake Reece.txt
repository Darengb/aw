[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:09}
Do you get it on the first of the month?

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:08:11}
Well, not on the first, but, like…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:13}
Okay, so then…

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:08:14}
I… I'm pretty… It's… Hold on, let me check my… cause I, I, I got it… I think I get it before the first of the month, or around the time. Around the.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:27}
Check the time of.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:08:28}
The beginning of the month.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:29}

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:08:30}
Over the last month.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:32}
Okay.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:08:33}
Uh, but if you want the exact date, I'd have to…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:35}
No, I don't need the exact date. I don't need the exact date, Jabe. It's fine.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:08:46}
I get it because of, uh, my disability, because I've…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:51}
It's so disease.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:08:57}
I don't know if that helps, like, distinguish them between the two.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:09:02}
Certainly.
Just getting your mom's information, because she's your emergency contact.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:09:13}
How did you know?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:09:15}
My mom's my client, so who else are you gonna put as your emergency contact but your mother?

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:09:24}
I don't know, maybe if I had other people.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:09:27}
Wait, I mean, you are right.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:09:28}
But, I mean.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:09:29}
I'm just saying, like, I'm surprised you knew that. You're not gonna have your mother coming after me.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:09:38}
We're the only people of our.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:09:41}
I live in Florida, so I… Yes, I know, your mom told me that. It would have to be her, yes.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:09:50}
Yeah, I kind of wish my cousins, or one of my relatives, moved out of Florida.
They all live up north.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:11:09}
Now we're going over your employment history. Um, what is the name of your latest employer, the last employer that you worked for? Not the one that you're gonna start working for on Tuesday, but the one prior to that.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:11:23}
Um… my very last deployer… it… uh… let me… give me a second here, I gotta… I have to pull it up.
Um, it's… because I worked for Verizon, but they weren't Verizon themselves. They were, like… I went, and I were doing door-to-door.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:11:49}
Also, man.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:11:49}
taking, um, calls for Verizon customers, I would set up internet for the home.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:11:55}
It's…

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:11:56}
It's a company that Verizon worked for… well, worked with.
um… Okay, I have it here, but where is their name? What is their culture?
That's… How's their local in here, but I don't see their name on ours.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:13:32}
What is your position gonna be with McDonald's?

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:13:39}
I'm pretty sure I'll be, uh, I don't know what it's actually called, but I'll be, like, helping, um, finish… Food?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:13:50}
Okay.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:13:55}
Excuse me.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:13:55}
For right now, I just have.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:13:56}
like a… yeah, I have a… I work for them, but I don't have a general, like, assigned…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:14:01}
Mhm.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:14:02}
patient just yet.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:14:04}
Do you know how much they're paying you an hour?

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:14:07}
Yes, it's 15, um, 50.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:14:13}
And I'll just put maybe 25 hours a week that you'll be working.
Is it full-time or part-time? Do you know?

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:14:22}
It's full-time?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:14:23}
But I, again, I don't really…

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:14:25}
Uh huh.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:14:26}
know the sketch.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:14:27}
Cool.
I told them that I would much… I would like be… I should be working around, like, nights, um…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:14:34}
Mhm.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:14:35}
I don't, I don't know. We have to, I have to… Go back to see. Okay, I… Okay, um, it's in… it's Infinity Management Group?
That was my last…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:14:49}
Employer? Okay, give me one second, let me just… Today's date… Can you spell the first name?

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:15:03}
Woohoo.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:15:04}

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:15:06}
No, it's infinity.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:15:08}
infinity.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:15:09}
Mm-hmm.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:15:11}
Infinity Compass Group?

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:15:14}
Management.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:15:15}
Infinity Management Group? Yes.
What was your position?

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:15:26}
I… was, um… It was… it wasn't really, like, a defined… decision…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:15:36}
I was like.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:15:37}
So I would… I would go door-to-door, and then also, like, in the evenings, I would go door-to-door, and during the mornings, I would, like, take phone calls to help Um, people set up their internet, and if they had any internet problems.
So, Dora would be, like, a salesperson?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:15:58}
but also taking calls, I would just say customer service?

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:16:04}
Yeah, yeah, you could… It's… it was like a flex program between the two… well, a flex job, uh…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:16:18}
How much were you making an hour?

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:16:22}
I did not have, like, a minimum wage. It was… it was by… it was… the pay was… it was supposed to be bi-weekly.
Um, and I worked off commissions.
like… Hold on. I had… I had a minimum… base pay, with the, um, the phone calls.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:16:46}
Right.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:16:47}
it really… it really was off of commissions from my door-to-door sales, but I'd never really made, uh, too much, like… I think all of my checks combined, I only made Uh… $800?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:17:04}
Okay, we'll just use the same $15 an hour.
Because it doesn't allow me to put any commission, it only allows me to put, um, the base, um, hourly.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:17:18}
Okay.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:17:20}
When did you start working for them?

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:17:28}
It was a few.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:17:28}
It was a few.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {00:17:29}

But if you can't get it to Social Security, I'll send it to Social Security on your behalf, because you have to let them know that you're working.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {01:12:42}
Okay.
Uh, also… so, question…

5771.
The number that I'm talking to you on, that's my telephone number.
the number that I… text you. I said, this is my text number.
Only, meaning you can only text me via that number.
So I have a number where you can text me, and I have a number where you can call and talk to me. There are two different numbers.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {01:13:28}
Interesting. Why do they do that?

[Cynthia Wilson] {01:13:31}
Uh, did they do that? That's how the company has it set up.
Because I'm not talking to you through a cell phone, this is a business.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {01:13:42}
I mean, I understand it, but…

[Cynthia Wilson] {01:13:45}
Uh-huh. It's…

[Jabez Drake Reece] {01:13:46}
That's the first time I've come across that.

[Cynthia Wilson] {01:13:48}

So, right now, I'm talking to you through, um, an application called Zoom.
It's a Zoom phone, so that's how we are talking.
And, um… Then, when you text me.
You're texting me on the computer as well.
Which is a different number.

[Jabez Drake Reece] {01:14:14}
Okay.

[Cynthia Wilson] {01:14:25}
Okay.
Do you have any further questions for me?

[Jabez Drake Reece] {01:14:34}
Um… I don't necessarily have any further questions at this time.

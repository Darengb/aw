[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:02}
Well, happy holidays, Denarii! It's Cynthia with America Works. How are you?

[Denarii Maurice Turner] {00:00:07}
I'm okay, how are you? Happy holidays.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:09}
I'm doing well. I'm just calling to check in with you to see how things are going. I'm waiting for you to still send me.
Good. I'm still waiting for you to send me a copy of your, um, resume. Remember, I'm supposed to be updating, helping you with that?
What's your resume?

[Denarii Maurice Turner] {00:00:32}
Uh, I did not realize that you did not have that.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:36}
Yes, so I'm waiting for you to… Send me a copy of it so that I can help you with that.

[Denarii Maurice Turner] {00:00:44}
Okay.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:45}
Okay.

[Denarii Maurice Turner] {00:00:48}
Let me see… Okay, I'll get on that today.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:52}
Alright, awesome. Once I receive it, I'll look at it, and I'll call you, and we'll begin, um, updating it. Okay, how was your holidays? Everything was good?

[Denarii Maurice Turner] {00:01:02}
this, this, man.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:04}
Alright, good.
Alright, well, I'll speak with you soon, okay?

[Denarii Maurice Turner] {00:01:08}
Yeah, I'm still in the process of, um, following up with the airport.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:14}
Okay, good.

[Denarii Maurice Turner] {00:01:15}
Um, they told me… I went on Monday.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:19}
I have bonds with it.

[Denarii Maurice Turner] {00:01:20}
to the CAO, um…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:23}
Okay. And then…

[Denarii Maurice Turner] {00:01:24}
told me to just apply. Um, a lot of the bartending positions would like for you to have the, uh, food handling certification, so I'm in the.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:34}
I have to study them.

[Denarii Maurice Turner] {00:01:34}
that as well.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:36}
Okay, okay, awesome.

[Denarii Maurice Turner] {00:01:39}
Thank you. You're welcome. Um…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:42}
We… As soon as I see when the food or, uh, the food protection study group, um, training session is available, I'll reach out to you, um, and you can take it through America Works as well.

[Denarii Maurice Turner] {00:01:56}
Thank you.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:57}
Okay?

[Denarii Maurice Turner] {00:01:59}
Thank you very much.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:00}
Alright, Denari, I'll speak with you soon.

[Denarii Maurice Turner] {00:02:03}
northeastern.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:04}
Okay, bye-bye.

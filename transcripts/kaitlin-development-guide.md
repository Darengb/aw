# Development Guide for Kaitlin

## Your Development Goals

Kaitlin, you're consistently hitting your call volume and revenue targets—that's not easy, and it shows real discipline. This guide is about building on that foundation to create deeper client impact.

### Why This Matters

Many of our clients stay on disability not because they *can't* work, but because they lack confidence in their ability to get and keep a job. Our role is to help them see possibilities they don't see for themselves—and build the confidence they need to take that step.

**The funnel**: Prospecting → Coached → Connected to Employer → Placed in Job

When clients don't feel encouraged or supported, they drop out of the funnel before we can help them. Active engagement isn't just "better service"—it's what moves clients toward job placements.

| Goal | What It Looks Like |
|------|-------------------|
| **Active Engager** | Drive conversations with questions and suggestions |
| **Encourager** | Help clients feel motivated and capable |
| **Solution Provider** | Offer resources and alternatives proactively |
| **Client Advocate** | Go to bat for clients when they face obstacles |
| **Closer** | End calls with clear next steps and warm send-offs |

## Building Toward Your Goals

### 1. Active Engager: Replace One-Word Passive Responses

Short responses like "Mhm," "Yeah," "Okay," and "Right, right" signal you're listening but don't add value. Clients need more from you.

**Instead of**:
> Client: "I want to continue attending two webinars."
> "Okay."

**Try**:
> "That's great—which webinars are you looking at? I might know some good ones coming up."

**Instead of**:
> Client: "I was tired from cleaning, so I took it easy."
> "Nice!"

**Try**:
> "You've earned that rest. How's the job search going alongside everything else?"

**The rule**: Every response should either ask a follow-up question or add something useful.

---

### 2. Encourager: Lift Clients Up When They're Down

When clients express discouragement, they need more than agreement.

**Instead of**:
> Client: "It's a little hard to keep going, I'm gonna admit."
> "That's true. That's very true."

**Try**:
> "I hear you—it's tough. But don't give up. The right opportunity is going to come. What can we do this week to keep momentum going?"

**Instead of**:
> Client: "I think I kind of gave up after a while. But I keep telling myself, well, you gotta keep trying, or you're not gonna get anything."
> "Okay"

**Try**:
> "I understand that feeling. But you're here now, talking to me, which means you haven't really given up. Let's figure out a new approach together."

**Phrases to use**:
- "Don't give up. The right door is going to open."
- "I think you're going to do great."
- "You've got the experience—employers can see that."
- "This is temporary. We're going to get you to something better."

### 3. Solution Provider: Offer Help Before Being Asked

Don't wait for clients to ask—bring ideas to them.

**Instead of** waiting for the client to lead:
> Client: "So, for my goals for the next 2 weeks, I want to continue attending webinars..."
> "Okay."

**Try**:
> "I love that you're doing webinars. Have you seen the one on [specific topic] coming up? I can register you. Also, I found a few job leads this week that might fit your background—want me to send them over?"

**Phrases to use**:
- "I'm thinking about your situation, and here's an idea..."
- "Have you considered [alternative approach]?"

---

### 4. Client Advocate: Go to Bat for Them

When clients face obstacles, don't just acknowledge—offer to help solve.

**Phrases to use**:
- "Let me look into that for you."
- "That's not okay—I can help follow up on your behalf."
- "I'm going to make sure this gets resolved."

---

### 5. Patience: Reframe Repeated Questions

Clients sometimes need information multiple times. That's normal—the material is complex.

**Instead of**:
> "Remember, I've sent you this information about 4 different times. Um, you have to talk to Social Security. Let me resend it to you."

**Try**:
> "No problem—this stuff is complicated. Let me walk you through it again, and I'll send you a fresh copy. Feel free to ask anytime; that's what I'm here for."

**Mindset shift**: Repeating information isn't a failure—it's part of the job. Clients aren't trying to frustrate you; they're trying to understand a complex system.

---

### 6. Knowledge Builder: Handle Gaps Gracefully

You won't know everything—that's okay. But don't leave it at "No" or "I don't know."

**Instead of**:
> Client: "Have you heard of Prop 22?"
> "No."
> Client: "Okay, what it is, it's kind of weird."
> "Okay."

**Try**:
> "I'm not familiar with that one. Tell me more about it, and I'll do some research after our call so I can help you better next time."

**Phrases to use**:
- "I don't know that off the top of my head, but let me find out for you."
- "Good question—I'll research that and follow up."
- "I want to make sure I give you accurate information, so let me look into it."

---

### 7. Closer: End Strong

The end of the call is your last impression. Make it count.

**Instead of**:
> "Is there anything else I can help you with today?"
> "Excellent."
> "Sounds good to me!"
> "Alright, well, Happy New Year, and we will talk in a few weeks."

**Try**:
> "Okay, let me recap what we covered: you're going to [action 1], and I'm going to [action 2]. I'll check in with you in two weeks to see how it went. You've got this—keep pushing forward, and call me if anything comes up before then."

**Strong close formula**:
1. Recap what the client will do
2. Recap what you will do
3. Set the next check-in
4. End with encouragement

## What Excellence Looks Like

The best client coaches don't just answer questions—they help clients see their future. Here's what top performers do:

### Ask Vision Questions

Instead of jumping into logistics, open with big-picture questions:

> "So, what do you see yourself doing within the next 5 years? What type of job would you be looking for?"

This positions you as a guide to their future, not just someone handling paperwork.

### Create Client Narratives

Transform client information into an inspiring story and read it back:

> "Let me read you what I've written about your goals: 'You're someone who has identified a long-term goal focused on self-sufficiency. You're currently building work experience that provides foundational skills. Your plan is to use this position as a stepping stone toward a role with better pay and benefits. This reflects your commitment to financial independence and sustainable career growth.' How does that sound?"

One client responded: *"I mean, it sounds pretty solid when you say it like that."*

### Balance Encouragement with Challenge

> "All of this stuff, you have to start writing down and looking into it. This is something you want to do, so you really have to start researching it."

> "You always have to be ready. Always."

This pushes clients forward while showing you believe in them.

### Celebrate Wins Enthusiastically

> **Client:** "I actually just recently came into possession of a vehicle."
> **Response:** "Oh, congratulations!"

Small celebrations help clients recognize their own progress.

### Make Clients Feel Welcome

> "Welcome to the AmericaWorks Ticket to Work program. I'll be your case manager, and I'll be speaking with you on a monthly basis. You can text me, email me, and I will respond."

This transforms bureaucracy into the start of a real partnership.

1. Before each call, prepare 2 job leads and 1 resource to offer
2. Replace every "Mhm/Yeah/Okay" with a follow-up question
3. Use one encouragement phrase per call

**This month**:
4. Practice the strong close formula on every call
5. Follow up on one client issue personally (advocate for them)
6. When you don't know something, research it and call the client back

*You have the consistency and discipline. Now add the engagement, and you'll see real client breakthroughs.*

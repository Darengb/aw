Hello?

[Adrien Martino] {00:00:01}
Hi, good morning. This is Adrienne Martino with America Works. I'm calling for Matthew Riker.

[(505) 785-4158] {00:00:08}
This is Matthew.

[Adrien Martino] {00:00:09}
Okay. I'm calling about the Ticket to Work program under Social Security. You've heard of that before?
Um…

[(505) 785-4158] {00:00:16}
I'm not 100% sure, no.

[Adrien Martino] {00:00:18}
Okay, um, it's about… finding employment for SSI and SSDI recipients. Is that something you're looking into? Um…

[(505) 785-4158] {00:00:28}
It's possible, but I'm not really sure. You know, the thing about… I've thought about working over the years, but the problem with working is, um, when my mental health gets real bad.

[Adrien Martino] {00:00:37}
Because the last driver.

[(505) 785-4158] {00:00:38}
I had… they ended up letting me go. I mean, they found a way to let me go, because I was…

[Adrien Martino] {00:00:42}
It's in the mental world.

[(505) 785-4158] {00:00:43}
So many times, and they had to cover my.

[Adrien Martino] {00:00:44}
shit so many times.

[(505) 785-4158] {00:00:46}
that they just got sick and tired of it, and they just made up any excuse they could to get rid of me. So, if that's a problem.

[Adrien Martino] {00:00:50}
Ooh, the future, it's not a problem right now.

[(505) 785-4158] {00:00:52}
now, but if it's a problem in the future, it's going to be a problem for any employer I go to, you know, because they can't…

[Adrien Martino] {00:00:56}
We don't have extra people to cover.

[(505) 785-4158] {00:00:57}
shift. Does that make sense?

[Adrien Martino] {00:00:59}
Yep, yeah, no doubt. Yeah, so I just refrained from getting a job right now.

[(505) 785-4158] {00:01:02}
now, because the only thing I've ever done in the past is mostly, uh, cooking and assistant manager jobs, and there's really nobody to replace you. I've done some.

[Adrien Martino] {00:01:08}
Customer service didn't want.

[(505) 785-4158] {00:01:09}
Again, there's nobody to replace you.

[Adrien Martino] {00:01:11}
You're not there for your shift.

[(505) 785-4158] {00:01:12}
And the manager can only work so many doubles.

[Adrien Martino] {00:01:14}
domain manager. Right, yep. Okay, no, that makes sense. Um, totally understand. If you were ever looking into it again, um, you're welcome to give us a call. We can answer any questions that you might have about your benefits and all of that.
Um, but yeah, that makes sense. I mean, that's why disability exists, so… I can't work, you don't have to. Yep. All right, well, I will let you get on with your day. Of course, Happy New Year. Have a good day. Thanks, bye-bye.

# Staff Performance Analysis Report

## Overview

This report analyzes call transcripts from America Works Ticket to Work program staff to identify what distinguishes high-performing staff from lower-performing staff. The goal is to identify specific behaviors, communication patterns, and techniques that can be used for training and improvement.

### About the Program

America Works' Ticket to Work program helps SSDI recipients find employment. Staff members:
- **Prospect**: Reach out to clients on disability to let them know about opportunities
- **Coach**: Build confidence in clients who may stay on disability due to lack of confidence in their ability to work
- **Educate**: Explain job assistance programs and benefits
- **Connect**: Help clients find and secure employment

### What the Ratings Measure

**Ratings reflect actual client outcomes**—the number of clients each staff member has successfully transitioned through the full funnel:

```
Prospecting → Coached → Connected to Employer → Placed in Job
```

This means high performers aren't just "nice" or "professional"—they're actually converting more clients into successful job placements.

### Staff Ratings

| Staff Member | Rating | Transcripts Analyzed |
|--------------|--------|---------------------|
| Cynthia Wilson | 10 | 11 |
| Squeak Stone | 9 | 4 |
| Ana Arvelo | 7 | 6 |
| Adrien Martino | 7 | 7 |
| Kaitlin | 2 | 8 |

### Key Insight

The behavioral differences identified in this report directly correlate with placement outcomes:
- **Cynthia's vision-casting and narrative-building** → Clients see themselves as capable of working → More placements
- **Squeak's advocacy and encouragement** → Clients feel supported through barriers → More placements
- **Kaitlin's passive responses** → Clients don't feel confident or motivated → Fewer placements
- **Adrien's quick acceptance of barriers** → Prospects don't convert to coached clients → Fewer placements

## High Performers

### Cynthia Wilson (Rating: 10)

#### 1. Professional and Warm Greeting

Cynthia opens calls with a complete, professional greeting that immediately establishes credibility:

> "Good morning, thank you for calling America Works, the Ticket to Work program. This is Cynthia Wilson speaking, how may I help you?"

#### 2. Proactive Encouragement and Emotional Support

When clients express frustration or discouragement, Cynthia actively provides encouragement:

> **Client:** "It's been a rough month... it is a bit depressing."
>
> **Cynthia:** "But don't give up. It can be, but don't give up, you know, just… the right door is going to open, I always say that."

#### 3. Offers Concrete Solutions and Alternatives

Rather than just listening, Cynthia proactively suggests resources and alternatives:

> "Have you, um, looked at any of the apprenticeship programs?"

> "If anything, so I did… I'm trying… I know you were! Mental, mental has been so mental."

When a client mentions starting a coffee business:

> **Client:** "I thought about going to my SBA and seeing if I could start some kind of coffee business."
>
> **Cynthia:** "That would be something exactly... Better than nothing. Right."

#### 4. Builds Personal Rapport

Cynthia engages in genuine personal conversation that builds trust:

> **Cynthia:** "How was your New Year's, by the way? It was nice, thank you so much for asking. I'm just thankful to still be here, thankful… Yes. Take every… every day as a new blessing, and I'm so appreciative of it."

> **Client:** "I never go to the ball drop."
>
> **Cynthia:** "No, I, I… I never go, I never wanted to go, mm-mm, that's not for me... It's for tourists and actors, you know? Yes, that's who it's for. I always say that. It's for the tourists. It's not for people that actually live here."

#### 5. Thorough Information Gathering

During intake calls, Cynthia methodically collects all necessary information while keeping the client engaged:

> "Okay, and how do you spell your first name? J-A-D-E-Z?"

> "What is your, um, telephone number?"

> "What is your email address?"

> "What is your date of birth?"

She confirms information by reading it back:

> "1102 Ray Charles Boulevard, Tampa, Florida, 33602."

> "094944912." [reading back social security number for verification]

#### 6. Makes Small Talk During Wait Times

When processing information, Cynthia keeps clients engaged rather than leaving awkward silence:

> "One second… How's the weather out there?"

#### 7. Explains Program Services Thoroughly

Cynthia reads through service descriptions so clients understand exactly what they're getting:

> "America Works will provide comprehensive planning services to support Jabez in achieving your short-term and long-term employment goals. These services will include individualized goal setting to identify your career interests, strengths, and employment objectives."

> "America Works will assist you with job development activities, including identifying employment opportunities, preparing for employment advancement, and supporting transitions from entry-level work to career-focused positions."

#### 8. Sets Clear Expectations

Cynthia ensures clients know exactly what's expected of them:

> "When you, um, start working at McDonald's and you get your pay stubs, it's mandatory that you make sure that you send me copies of all of your pay stubs, and then you will also have to send copies of your pay stubs to Social Security."

> "Yes, you can text me, you can email me, and I will respond. But it's mandatory that we speak to each other once a month."

#### 9. Proactive Resource Offering

Without being asked, Cynthia offers to create resources for clients:

> **Client:** "Does it wonder? Cause I don't really have, like, a formal resume."
>
> **Cynthia:** "Okay, if you don't have a resume, what I will need you to do is email me the names of the companies that you worked for. Period that you worked for them, and what was your position? So that I can create a resume for you."

#### 10. Provides Gentle Accountability

Cynthia pushes clients to think about their goals while remaining supportive:

> **Client:** "Enough to afford a house?"
>
> **Cynthia:** "All of this stuff, you have to start writing down and looking into it, and, you know, this is something that you want to do, so you really have to start researching it."

> **Client:** "I mean, I haven't researched it, but like… like, these notes on hand."
>
> **Cynthia:** "You always have to be ready. Always."

#### 11. Comprehensive Closing

Cynthia ends calls with a complete summary and welcome:

> "So you enjoy the rest of your day. Welcome to the AmericaWorks Ticket to Work program. As you're already aware, my name is Cynthia Wilson, I'll be your Ticket to Work case manager, and I'll be speaking with you on a monthly basis."

---

### Squeak Stone (Rating: 9)

#### 1. Strong Client Advocacy

When a client reports that another staff member fabricated information on their resume, Squeak immediately validates and takes action:

> **Client:** "She's trying to screw up my resume. I never worked for Home Depot in my entire life."
>
> **Squeak:** "Right, right. Yeah, I wrote… did you see what she wrote back? And I'm… I'm really… I'm gonna actually kind of report her, because that's…"

> "Yeah, no, that is really not… Not okay. Very not okay. Well, I'm actually gonna talk to my supervisor about that, because she can't be… she cannot be inventing histories for people."

> "Who is her supervisor? I'm not exactly sure. I'm gonna… I'm gonna find out, because that's just unethical behavior. Absolutely unethical."

#### 2. Validates Client Concerns Completely

Squeak doesn't hedge or minimize - she fully validates:

> "Nope, nope, yep, I 100% agree with you."

> "Yeah, you don't want to lie on a resume. No, it's Yeah."

#### 3. Positive Reinforcement and Confidence Building

Squeak actively builds client confidence before interviews:

> "Good, good, good. I think you're going to do great, you know, and especially since you've worked with them in the past, and you worked with them the longest. You were there for about 3 years, and that says a lot, you know, so… and you've got that cashier experience, they could see that?"

#### 4. Remembers and Acknowledges Previous Conversations

Squeak shows she pays attention and remembers details:

> "But thank you so much also for the photo. I really, really enjoyed seeing you. That was great. That was really, really lovely."

> **Client:** "That's a transformation in his own style."
>
> **Squeak:** "That's amazing. Absolutely amazing."

#### 5. Reinforces Good Behaviors

When clients demonstrate positive habits, Squeak reinforces them:

> **Client:** "I always show up maybe 15, 20 minutes early."
>
> **Squeak:** "That's perfect."

> "Yeah, absolutely. No, that's really good practice. Really, really good practice."

#### 6. Shares Personal Stories to Build Connection

Squeak creates genuine rapport by sharing her own experiences:

> "My, my, my husband says to be early is to be late. No, to be on time is to be late. You know, and… Yeah. You know, I mean, sometimes he, he exacerbates me, he gets me really, like, we end up at the airport, like, 6 hours before a flight, you know, but he doesn't want…"

> "Yeah, I mean, I did absolutely really nothing on New Year's Eve. Um, my son is actually in… Poland visiting right now, a friend of his. So, at about 6 p.m. my time, he called, because it was midnight there, and he was all happy to wish me a Happy New Year, and that just, like, made me so happy, you know, that he's someplace had actually thought about me, you know, it's like, aww!"

#### 7. Proactive Follow-Up Offers

Squeak makes it clear she's available to help:

> "Well, listen, good luck with your interview. Keep me posted. If you need anything from me, um, let me know, okay?"

#### 8. Checks on Interview Preparation

Squeak follows up on practical preparation:

> "Well, and have you been practicing the interview questions so you don't get caught up again?"

## Middle Performers

### Ana Arvelo (Rating: 7)

Ana demonstrates many strong skills and falls closer to the high performers than the low performers. She is thorough, knowledgeable about the program, and proactive with resources. Her main areas for growth are emotional support and client advocacy.

#### 1. Professional Greeting with Full Introduction

Ana opens calls professionally with her name and program:

> "Good morning, this is Anna Arvelo from America Works with the Ticket to Work program speaking. How can I help you?"

#### 2. Thorough Program Knowledge and Explanation

Ana excels at explaining complex benefits information clearly:

> "As a reminder, the way that works is you get 9 months. Um, in which you can work and earn as much as you can. You get to keep your Social Security check, as well as the money from work. Um, for 9 months, then you have a transitional period. You get, um, 1 month of cessation. That's, you know, after the 9th, that 10th month is saying, okay, get ready to transition to the next phase of the program."

> "Once you start earning after that $1,690 monthly gross, that's when the benefit would suspend. And by benefit, I mean cash payment. Yeah, because you still get your other… there are other benefits, um, to the Ticket to Work program, such as if you have Medicare, you get that for 93 months consecutive, so that's untouched."

#### 3. Proactive Resource Offering

Ana actively offers multiple resources without being asked:

> "Have you ever checked your state's, um, Career One Stop Job Bank, like, they have a bunch of… like, anytime a job is available, they'll kind of dump it in there, and you can periodically check to see what jobs are available in your area."

> "I'll send it to you with your zip code, like, with what jobs are within 5 miles of your zip code, and we can start there."

When a client doesn't qualify for the program, she still provides help:

> "Wait, before you go, Mr. Armore. One second, hello? I want to provide you with a resource before you hang up. Yeah, I want to give you something to, um… I don't know if you've ever looked at your job… your state jobs bank?"

#### 4. Offers Resume Assistance Proactively

> "Do you need help reviewing it? Like, do you want me to edit it, or leave it as is?"

> "So what I will need that other job for, though, is your resume. Do you have a copy of your resume? Or do you need help creating it?"

#### 5. Explains Transportation Benefits Thoroughly

When a client asks about transportation help, Ana provides comprehensive information:

> "Great question. Yep, we can help you before getting employed if you can, um, show proof that you have an interview scheduled. We can help you, you know, by sending you a gas card to get to the job interview. That's one. Number 2, uh, you get up to 12 Visa gas cards. You're entitled to 12. Um, and your duration here, um, as long as you work 30 hours, and you provide your pay stubs."

When the client mentions getting rides from others:

> "If you get the ride, you could still do the gas card, because you can help out whoever is giving you the ride."

#### 6. Emphasizes Communication Partnership

Ana clearly establishes the two-way communication expectation:

> "I'm glad that you mentioned that communication piece, because that's actually one of the most important things of the program, is honest, two-way communication, right? Like, if I know what's going… the more I know what's going on, the more I can help you."

> "I'm a big communicator. You'll see that I email a lot. I call at least once a month just to check in."

#### 7. Provides Encouragement (But Less Than Top Performers)

Ana does offer encouragement, though less emotionally than Cynthia or Squeak:

> "I've been hearing that a lot at the end of last year. Um, so I'm hoping this year's a little better, so you're not alone in that. I don't want you to feel alone. It's been rough. But the good news, I've been hearing some of my other clients, slowly but surely, people are getting hired."

#### 8. Builds Some Personal Rapport

Ana engages in personal conversation, though less extensively than top performers:

> **Ana:** "And the date of birth I have is… oh, it's your birthday month, on January 23rd."
>
> **Client:** "Yes."
>
> **Ana:** "Happy early birthday... It's 2 days after my mother's. So I'm a late birthday present."

> "Take it one day at a time. Be grateful for every day, absolutely. You never know. Yup, yup, grateful to be here."

#### 9. Handles Difficult Conversations Professionally

When a client wants part-time work (which doesn't align with the program), Ana handles it professionally while still helping:

> "The only thing is that with our program, you have to be looking for full-time to be able to, um, be working with AmeriCorps. Um, and also the goal is to get off of your benefits in the long term. But if that doesn't align with you, what I can do is refer you to your local state vocational rehabilitation, because they can help you find a part-time."

> "That's okay, it happens sometimes. You're welcome. You know, we just do what's best for you, the client, right?"

#### 10. Proactive About Training Opportunities

Ana mentions specific training she'll look for:

> "I'm gonna be adding you to my email list, so that email list is I… when there's trainings, I send them out. I'll be looking out for the OSHA for you. They offer it virtually."

#### Areas for Improvement (Compared to Top Performers)

**Less Emotional Support**: While Ana provides some encouragement, she doesn't match Cynthia's level of emotional support when clients express discouragement. Compare:

> **Ana:** "I'm hoping this year's a little better, so you're not alone in that."

vs.

> **Cynthia:** "But don't give up. It can be, but don't give up, you know, just… the right door is going to open, I always say that."

**Less Client Advocacy**: Ana doesn't demonstrate the strong advocacy that Squeak shows (e.g., offering to report issues or escalate problems on behalf of clients).

**More Transactional at Times**: Some of Ana's calls feel more process-focused than relationship-focused compared to top performers.

---

## Lower Performers

### Kaitlin (Rating: 2)

#### 1. Passive Listening with Minimal Engagement

Kaitlin's responses are often one-word acknowledgments that add no value:

> **Client:** "It was quiet."
>
> **Kaitlin:** "Nice!"

> **Client:** "I was tired from the air and cleaning, so I took it easy."
>
> **Kaitlin:** "Nice!"

> **Client:** "And, um, I'm a little nervous about the timelines, but…"
>
> **Kaitlin:** "That's great."

Throughout transcripts, Kaitlin frequently responds with only:
- "Mhm."
- "Yeah."
- "Right, right."
- "Okay."
- "Mm-hmm."

#### 2. Lets Client Drive Entire Conversation

In the call with Chino Uchida, the client presents their own goals, their own progress, and their own plans while Kaitlin mostly listens:

> **Client:** "So, for the small goals for next 2 weeks. I want to continue attending two webinars."
>
> **Kaitlin:** "Okay."

> **Client:** "The second goal is I want to continue working on, uh, the… data collection."
>
> **Kaitlin:** "So, yep."

> **Client:** "God, and then the third one… I want to see a friend who always comes and picks up on me."
>
> **Kaitlin:** "Aww."

The client is essentially self-managing while Kaitlin provides minimal input.

#### 3. Sounds Frustrated When Repeating Information

Rather than patiently re-explaining, Kaitlin shows frustration:

> "Remember, I've sent you this information about 4 different times. Um, you have to talk to Social Security. Um, let me resend it to you."

#### 4. Knowledge Gaps

When a client asks about California wage laws, Kaitlin doesn't know:

> **Client:** "Have you heard of Top 22?"
>
> **Kaitlin:** "No."

> **Client:** "Okay, what it is, it's kind of weird."
>
> **Kaitlin:** "Okay."

While it's acceptable not to know everything, Kaitlin doesn't offer to research or follow up.

#### 5. Vague, Generic Advice

When clients need guidance, Kaitlin gives non-specific responses:

> **Client:** "It's a little hard to keep going, I'm gonna admit."
>
> **Kaitlin:** "That's true. That's very true."

Compare this to Cynthia's response to similar discouragement: "Don't give up. The right door is going to open, I always say that."

#### 6. Missed Opportunities for Advocacy

When a client is frustrated about not hearing back on webinar materials:

> **Client:** "I request the slides from the webinars, but they haven't arrived yet."
>
> **Kaitlin:** "Oh."

> **Client:** "Some of them were from, like, mid-December, and I'm forgetting the materials."
>
> **Kaitlin:** "Well, I think that reaching back out is okay. Did you email them?"

Compare to Squeak, who immediately offers to escalate issues and advocate for clients.

#### 7. Lack of Proactive Solutions

When a client mentions struggling with the job search:

> **Client:** "I never got… I'm getting the same thing that I got then. Nothing."
>
> **Kaitlin:** "Right, right."

> **Client:** "And I think I kind of gave up after a while."
>
> **Kaitlin:** "That's true. That's very true."

No encouragement offered. No alternative strategies suggested.

#### 8. Generic Closing Without Personal Touch

> "Um, is there anything else I can help you with today?"

> "Excellent."

> "Sounds good to me!"

> "You're welcome. Alright, well, Happy New Year, and we will talk in a few weeks… in a couple weeks."

Compare to Cynthia's comprehensive, welcoming close that reinforces the relationship and expectations.

## Recommendations for Training

### Immediate Actions for Kaitlin (Low Performer)

1. **Active Engagement Training**: Replace passive responses ("Mhm", "Yeah") with engaged responses that add value or ask follow-up questions.

2. **Encouragement Scripts**: Provide specific phrases to use when clients express discouragement:
   - "Don't give up. The right door is going to open."
   - "I think you're going to do great."
   - "You've got the experience, they can see that."

3. **Proactive Solution Offering**: Train to offer at least 2-3 alternative resources or suggestions per call, rather than waiting to be asked.

4. **Client Advocacy Standards**: Establish clear protocols for escalating client issues and advocating on their behalf.

5. **Call Structure Template**: Provide a framework for calls that includes:
   - Professional greeting with full name and program
   - Personal check-in (How are you? How was your holiday?)
   - Progress review with specific questions
   - Proactive resource/suggestion offering
   - Clear next steps and expectations
   - Warm, comprehensive closing

### Development Areas for Ana (Middle Performer)

Ana is already performing well in many areas. To reach the level of top performers:

1. **Emotional Support Enhancement**: Practice more empathetic responses when clients express frustration:
   - Move from "You're not alone in that" to "Don't give up - I've seen people in similar situations succeed"
   - Add more confidence-building statements like "I think you're going to do great"

2. **Client Advocacy Development**: Learn from Squeak's approach of immediately offering to escalate issues:
   - When clients face problems, offer to intervene directly
   - Use phrases like "Let me look into this for you" or "I'll follow up with them on your behalf"

3. **Deeper Personal Connection**: Spend slightly more time on personal rapport:
   - Share more personal stories (like Squeak's family anecdotes)
   - Remember and reference details from previous conversations

### Shadowing Recommendations

- Have Kaitlin shadow Cynthia's calls to observe active engagement techniques
- Have Ana shadow Squeak's calls to observe advocacy and emotional support styles
- Record exemplary calls from Cynthia and Squeak for training purposes

### Metrics to Track

- Number of resources/suggestions offered per call
- Client-reported satisfaction
- Follow-through on action items
- Time spent on personal rapport vs. administrative tasks
- Number of advocacy interventions offered per call

---

## Conclusion

The primary difference between high and low performers is **active vs. passive engagement**. High performers like Cynthia and Squeak drive conversations, offer solutions before being asked, advocate strongly for clients, and build genuine personal connections. Low performers like Kaitlin tend to be reactive, provide minimal value-add responses, and miss opportunities to encourage and support clients.

Middle performers like Ana demonstrate strong foundational skills—thorough program knowledge, proactive resource offering, and professional communication—but have room to grow in emotional support and client advocacy. Ana is much closer to the top performers than to the bottom, and with focused development in a few areas, could reach Cynthia and Squeak's level.

The good news is that these are learnable skills. With targeted training, scripted responses for common situations, and shadowing opportunities, all staff can develop the engagement habits that make Cynthia and Squeak so effective.

### Performance Spectrum

```
Low                          Middle                         High
|---------------------------|------------------------------|
Kaitlin (2)                 Ana (7)                        Squeak (9)  Cynthia (10)
                            Adrien (7)
```

**Key Insight**: The gap between Ana (7) and the top performers is smaller than the gap between Ana and Kaitlin. This suggests Ana needs refinement rather than fundamental changes, while Kaitlin needs comprehensive retraining.

## Deep Dive: Why Cynthia Outperforms Ana

Despite Ana's many positive qualities, there is a 3-point gap between her rating (7) and Cynthia's (10). A deeper analysis of their transcripts reveals several key differences that explain this gap.

### 1. Vision Creation vs. Information Processing

**Cynthia transforms client information into compelling narratives about their future.** She doesn't just collect data—she creates meaning.

> **Cynthia (to Jabez):** "Jabez Drake Reece is a beneficiary who has identified a long-term employment goal focused on entrepreneurship and self-sufficiency. Jabez is currently enrolled in school, working towards the completion of his engineering degree, which will provide him with foundational technical business and problem-solving skills. Upon completion of his education, Jabez plans to pursue entrepreneurship as a small business owner by opening and operating his own barbershop."

> **Client response:** "I mean, it sounds pretty solid when you say it like that."

Cynthia takes a vague answer ("Enough to afford a house?") and transforms it into a professional, inspiring vision statement that makes the client see themselves differently.

**Ana captures information accurately but doesn't create this narrative transformation.** She focuses on ensuring clients understand the rules rather than helping them see their future selves.

### 2. Proactive Challenge vs. Reactive Support

**Cynthia gently challenges clients to think bigger and be more prepared:**

> "All of this stuff, you have to start writing down and looking into it, and, you know, this is something that you want to do, so you really have to start researching it."

> "You always have to be ready. Always."

**Ana validates and supports but rarely challenges:**

> "No, these are all very excellent questions, and I encourage you to keep asking."

> "You're rebuilding your work experience. That counts for something, absolutely."

Ana's responses are supportive and correct, but they don't push clients toward greater self-accountability.

### 3. Ownership vs. Referral

**Cynthia takes full ownership of complex conversations**, including benefits counseling and difficult topics.

**Ana defers complex matters to her manager (who is Cynthia):**

> "We still have to schedule your benefits counseling meeting, um, with my manager, Cynthia, because, um, it'll help even clarify this even more."

> "When you meet with my manager, Cynthia Wilson, she will be able to go over that more in detail."

This pattern suggests Ana may not feel fully confident handling the deepest client conversations, or that she sees Cynthia as the real expert.

### 4. Emotional Elevation vs. Practical Support

**Cynthia elevates clients emotionally** by celebrating wins and making them feel significant:

> **Client:** "I actually just recently came into possession of a vehicle."
>
> **Cynthia:** "Oh, congratulations!"

> **Cynthia:** "Welcome to the AmericaWorks Ticket to Work program. As you're already aware, my name is Cynthia Wilson, I'll be your Ticket to Work case manager, and I'll be speaking with you on a monthly basis."

This welcome feels like an initiation into something meaningful.

**Ana is sympathetic but less celebratory:**

> **Client:** "This place is bare minimum. There's no paid vacation..."
>
> **Ana:** "Oh, man, okay."

Ana acknowledges the difficulty but doesn't elevate or reframe the situation.

### 5. Future-Oriented Questions

**Cynthia asks big-picture questions that open up possibility:**

> "So, Jabez, what do you see yourself doing within the next 5 years? What type of job would you be looking for?"

**Ana focuses on immediate logistics:**

> "Would you like to schedule our appointment? We can schedule it ahead of time."

While Ana's logistical focus is valuable, she doesn't initiate the kind of visionary conversations that help clients dream bigger.

### 6. Identity Affirmation

**Cynthia creates language that affirms the client's identity:**

> "This long-term goal reflects Jabez's interest in business, ownership, financial independence, and sustainable career growth."

This language positions the client as someone with interests, goals, and a trajectory—not just a case to manage.

**Ana doesn't use this kind of identity-affirming language.** Her descriptions are accurate but transactional.

### 7. Real-Time Documentation as Engagement

**Cynthia reads back elaborate goal statements she's writing in real-time**, turning a bureaucratic task into an engaging experience where the client hears their life story being written:

> "America Works will provide comprehensive planning services to support Jabez in achieving your short-term and long-term employment goals. These services will include individualized goal setting to identify your career interests, strengths, and employment objectives..."

**Ana takes notes but doesn't make this a collaborative, engaging experience.**

### Summary: The Cynthia Difference

| Dimension | Cynthia (10) | Ana (7) |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Primary Mode** | Vision creator | Information processor |
| **Client Relationship** | Guide/mentor | Knowledgeable helper |
| **Approach to Challenges** | Gently challenges clients | Validates and supports |
| **Complex Conversations** | Takes full ownership | Defers to manager |
| **Emotional Impact** | Elevates and celebrates | Acknowledges and sympathizes |
| **Questions Asked** | "What do you see yourself doing?" | "When can we schedule?" |
| **Language Style** | Identity-affirming narratives | Accurate, practical |
| **Documentation** | Transforms into engagement | Administrative task |

### What Ana Can Learn from Cynthia

1. **Ask bigger questions**: Start conversations with "What do you see yourself doing in 5 years?" before diving into logistics.

2. **Create narratives**: Transform client information into compelling stories about their future. Read these back to clients.

3. **Challenge gently**: Add phrases like "You always have to be ready" and "You really have to start researching this."

4. **Take ownership**: Handle complex benefits conversations fully instead of deferring to management.

5. **Celebrate more**: Respond to client wins with genuine enthusiasm ("Oh, congratulations!") not just acknowledgment.

6. **Affirm identity**: Use language that positions clients as people with aspirations, not just cases to manage.

Ana has all the technical skills to be a top performer. The gap is primarily in **mindset and approach**—shifting from information processor to vision creator.

---

## Deep Dive: Adrien vs. Cynthia

Adrien (Rating: 7) presents a different comparison challenge than Ana. While Ana has many substantive coaching calls to analyze, most of Adrien's transcripts are **outbound prospecting calls** or **routing/transfer calls**—brief interactions that don't showcase coaching ability.

### What Adrien Does Well

#### 1. Professional, Efficient Greetings

Adrien opens calls clearly and professionally:

> "Good morning. This is Adrienne Martino with America Works. How can I help you?"

> "Hi, good morning. This is Adrienne with America Works. I'm calling for Matthew Riker."

#### 2. Handles Objections Gracefully

When a client expresses concerns about their ability to work, Adrien validates without pressure:

> **Client:** "The problem with working is, when my mental health gets real bad... they ended up letting me go."
>
> **Adrien:** "Yep, yeah, no doubt... Okay, no, that makes sense. Um, totally understand. If you were ever looking into it again, you're welcome to give us a call."

> **Client:** "Are you scamming me?"
>
> **Adrien:** "Uh, no, it's a free program, so, uh, no, I'm not scamming you. It's completely free."

#### 3. Reassures Clients About Errors

When a client is worried about a compliance email:

> "Those emails or, like, texts, they are often sent in error. Because I know people have called in the past, and it's be... and, like, most of the time, it was an error, it shouldn't have been sent."

#### 4. Takes Notes and Follows Up

Adrien gathers information and commits to action:

> "I will go ahead and reach out to her... for now, I'm just gonna send an email. Just so that she can follow up with you."

#### 5. Respects Client Boundaries

When clients aren't interested or can't talk, Adrien accepts gracefully:

> **Client:** "I'm sorry, I can't speak at this moment."
>
> **Adrien:** "Absolutely, totally fine. Alright, have a good day."

### The Gap: Call Type vs. Skill

**Key Observation:** Adrien's transcripts are predominantly:
- Outbound prospecting calls (cold/warm outreach)
- Routing calls (transferring to other staff)
- Brief interactions that end quickly

**Cynthia's transcripts are predominantly:**
- In-depth intake sessions
- Monthly coaching check-ins
- Benefits counseling conversations
- Substantive client relationship-building

Given that ratings measure **actual client placements through the full funnel**, Adrien's transcripts reveal a critical issue: **he's losing clients at the prospecting stage.**

### The Funnel Problem

When clients express barriers during prospecting calls, Adrien validates and closes rather than exploring possibilities. This means:

```
Prospecting → [DROP OFF] → Never Coached → Never Placed
```

Every prospect who expresses a barrier and gets "that makes sense, disability exists for a reason" is a potential placement lost.

### What We Can Observe

Even in brief calls, there are differences from Cynthia's approach:

| Behavior | Cynthia | Adrien |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **When client expresses concern** | Explores, problem-solves, offers alternatives | Validates and accepts |
| **Call depth** | Turns every interaction into coaching opportunity | Efficient, transactional |
| **Vision questions** | "What do you see yourself doing in 5 years?" | Not observed |
| **Challenge** | "You always have to be ready" | Accepts client's position |
| **Narrative building** | Creates inspiring stories about client's future | Not observed |

### Example: Missed Opportunity

When Matthew expressed concerns about mental health affecting his work:

**What Adrien said:**
> "Yep, yeah, no doubt... Okay, no, that makes sense. I mean, that's why disability exists, so... I can't work, you don't have to."

**What Cynthia might have said:**
> "I hear you—that's a real concern. But let me ask: have you thought about what kind of work environment might be different? Some of our clients find that remote work or flexible schedules can make a big difference. We could explore some options that might work better with your situation. What do you think?"

Adrien validated and closed. Cynthia would have explored and opened possibilities—and potentially converted Matthew into a coached client who could eventually be placed.

### The Core Issue

Many SSDI recipients stay on disability due to **lack of confidence**, not inability to work. Adrien's approach of accepting barriers reinforces their belief that they can't work. Cynthia's approach of exploring possibilities helps them see that they *can* work—which is the entire point of the program.

### Recommendation

**For Adrien:**
1. **Reframe barriers as openings**: When a client says "I can't work because X," treat it as the start of a conversation, not the end
2. **Ask possibility questions**: "If you could find a job that worked around that, what would it look like?"
3. **Challenge the disability mindset gently**: "A lot of our clients felt the same way, and we found solutions. Can I share what worked for them?"
4. **Convert more prospects to coaching**: The goal isn't to finish the call—it's to get them into the program

**Key Mindset Shift**: Adrien's job isn't to respect people's decision to stay on disability. It's to help them see possibilities they don't see for themselves. That's how placements happen.

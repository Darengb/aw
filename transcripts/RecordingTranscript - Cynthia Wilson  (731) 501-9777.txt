Thank you for calling America Works, the Ticket to Work program. This is Cynthia Wilson speaking. How may I help you today?

[(731) 501-9777] {00:00:08}
Yes, my name is Denisha Swift, and I was recently trying to see about finding a job.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:14}
Okay, Ms. Denisha, do you receive, um, Social Security or Social Security disability benefits?

[(731) 501-9777] {00:00:21}
Yes, ma'am.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:22}
And are you looking for full-time employment?

[(731) 501-9777] {00:00:28}
Um, not really part-time, as much as I can work up to… well, I can only make up to so much money.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:33}
Okay, so that you understand, the purpose of the Ticket to Work program is to help you to become self-sufficient through full-time employment, so that you can leave the dependency role of Social Security and become self-sufficient through working.
So this is not to supplement your benefits, it's to help you, um, eventually get off of your Social Security benefits.

[(731) 501-9777] {00:01:01}
Oh, I just got all my benefits. I'm sorry, I'm not trying to get off yet.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:05}
Okay.
Thus…

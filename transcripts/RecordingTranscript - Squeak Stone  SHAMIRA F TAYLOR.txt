[Squeak Stone] {00:00:00}
America Works, this is Squeak.

[SHAMIRA F TAYLOR] {00:00:04}
How are you doing today? Happy New Year.

[Squeak Stone] {00:00:06}
Happy New Year! How are you?

[SHAMIRA F TAYLOR] {00:00:08}
I'm hanging in there. Um, someone referred me to American Works, but I wanted to know, do you help pay for, um, like, help someone pay for education?

[Squeak Stone] {00:00:19}
Now, that's what a vocational rehab does. Um, there's… are you on SSA?
Disability, SSI, or SSDI, yeah. So, in the Ticket to Work program, there are two different types of, um.
agencies that provide services for Social Security, education, or employment. America Works is an employment network, and we don't fund education, but AccessVR does. Are you in New York, or where are you calling from?

[SHAMIRA F TAYLOR] {00:00:53}
No, I'm in Florida.

[Squeak Stone] {00:00:54}
You're in Florida, okay. Yeah, so your, um, vocational rehab would be able to provide, um, the funding. Where in Florida are you?

[SHAMIRA F TAYLOR] {00:01:06}
Um, I guess you could say I'm near Hollywood, Florida.

[Squeak Stone] {00:01:09}
Okay, and have you worked with Vocational rehab before?

[SHAMIRA F TAYLOR] {00:01:14}
Oh, many years ago, many years ago.

[Squeak Stone] {00:01:16}
Okay. Yeah.
Yeah, do you have… because I see that they have, um… They have a site on 7550 Davie Road Extension in Hollywood.
Do you need that information?

[SHAMIRA F TAYLOR] {00:01:34}
Um, I didn't know they had one. Oh, I think I know where that one is at.
Um… What was I gonna say?
So, what is American Works?

[Squeak Stone] {00:01:44}
So, America works… is a agency, but we don't do education. You know, we work on So we work on resumes, we help people to go back to work, you know, as soon as possible.
Um, using transferable skills that they've had from their past.
But we don't work on education for new skills. We do do some in-house trainings, but they're, like, one-hour webinars, they're not a degree.
Because we don't… America Works Employment Networks don't get the funding to pay for education the way a vocational rehab does.
So, you know, we would work on resumes, we'd help you to… go ahead.

[SHAMIRA F TAYLOR] {00:02:26}
Do you have… do you have contracts with employers?

[Squeak Stone] {00:02:29}
Uh, we don't have contracts. Basically, we're not a temp-to-hire.
What we're looking for is looking at what your long and your short-term goals are.
What are the barriers that you have for employment? What are accommodations you might need? And really looking at that short-term and that long-term goal.
And then looking at employers in your area who meet that, and really help you identify employers that are hiring to help you find what you're looking for. So we work for you, we're not working for an employer. We do have employers that we work with more regularly, some in different locations.
Um, but we aren't a temp to hire. We really are looking to find the employer for you. You know, I might have, um, a contract with a… Um, what do you call it? A, um… valet parking, but you might be interested in nuclear biology, right? So, I mean, I really don't want, you know, I want to make sure that if what you're looking for is one thing.
that I'm doing the research to help you find the opportunities that are there.
To meet those, to really meet your goal.

[SHAMIRA F TAYLOR] {00:03:44}
Oh, you mentioned New York City. Are you in New York?

[Squeak Stone] {00:03:46}
That's where our headquarters is, and that's the phone number you're dialing, is fed to our headquarters. Um, we work across the country. I have many people who are in the state of Florida. Um, but we do have 22 brick-and-mortar locations, but we also do a lot of virtual support.

[SHAMIRA F TAYLOR] {00:04:06}
Okay.
Alright, well, thank you for answering all of my questions. I'm still processing things.

[Squeak Stone] {00:04:12}
Okay, did you want to take the information of where the vocational rehab is, if you need funding for education, or their phone number?

[SHAMIRA F TAYLOR] {00:04:21}
Um… What's the word that I'm gonna say? Give me a second to… I need to think.
You can give me the phone number.

[Squeak Stone] {00:04:32}
Okay. Do you have a pen and paper ready?

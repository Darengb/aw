Hi, it's Kaitlin with America Works. I was just calling for our check-in today. Um… I can be reached at 802-204-3667, um… And I hope you're doing well, and Happy New Year! If I don't hear back from you today, I will try giving you a call. Let me just quickly look here at my calendar. Um… on Wednesday, January 14th, at 11am. If that doesn't work, just let me know. All right, I hope you're having a great day. Bye.

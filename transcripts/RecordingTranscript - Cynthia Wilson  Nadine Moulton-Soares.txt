[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:00:06}
6. I know you're almost ready to go home, but I'm on section 6, and it's asking about the monthly income.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:12}
I don't have those tools.
Two part-time jobs, right?

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:00:16}
what do I put? Because I don't even know, for the last, perhaps, 6 months.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:22}
That's them, I don't.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:00:23}
I don't even get tracked.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:24}
Well, your monthly… your monthly income fluctuates, right?

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:00:30}
Mhm.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:31}
Um, with your jobs. So, um… Let me see, I have it calculated on my end.
Um, I'll tell you what I have.
Based off of the pay stubs that Um, I have… So, for December, your gross monthly income was $3,630.35. For November, your Gross monthly income was $1,220.41.
For October, your gross monthly income was $396.85.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:01:13}
putting for this here? What am I putting on this?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:16}
You will, um… Normally, each month, your gross income isn't but so much.
put $1,220.41. Put the November number, and put that was your gross monthly income for November of…

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:01:47}
What's your one.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:48}
That was a combination of both of them.
North Shore and Mondelez.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:01:54}
November, um…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:56}
Yes, your gross income was $1,220.41.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:02:04}
And just put November side in.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:06}
Mm-hmm, and for December, Your gross income between both part-time jobs was $3,630.35.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:02:17}
Okay, so I'm putting those two numbers, and that one.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:21}
So this way, they'll see that it fluctuates.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:02:25}
Okay, um, and then for… in Section 2, under question 5, tell us what you know why the overpayment happened. I wrote I submit my pay subs as well as my source… my SS coordinator, and I'm not sure why it was not noticed. I don't even know if that makes…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:44}
fine.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:02:45}
Okay, so that's what I put for 5. And then, in question 2, under section 2, please explain, I chose all 3 boxes, as you said, and I said I've provided my pay stubs as requested, as well as my assess.
personnel, and who says, I have not… been in breach, and they also provide my pay stubs as, um, on record.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:03:09}
Mm.
This is not true.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:03:11}
Any arrow of mine.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:03:14}
Mm-hmm. That's what I.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:03:14}
But Fred, that one.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:03:16}

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:03:17}
There was one more that you said, I guess.
It asks for… dependent. I have no dependent that I pay my money on.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:03:28}
Mhm.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:03:30}
They asked of someone who lives with me. My dad lives with me, so I said yes, and they asked if they are payment, and I said no.

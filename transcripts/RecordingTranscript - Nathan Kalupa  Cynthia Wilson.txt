[Nathan Kalupa] {00:00:01}
Nate speaking.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:04}
Hey, this is Cynthia with America Works, how are you?

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:00:07}
Good, how are you?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:08}
I am doing well. I just was just checking in, wanted to wish you a Happy New Year. Happy New Year. I just wanted to check in with you.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:00:17}
Uh, thanks for checking in.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:19}
Um…

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:00:20}
Yeah.
It's been… it's been a rough month.
I have to say, they talk.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:27}
a few…

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:00:28}
friend said, uh… I had lunch with a friend yesterday who works for Dexcom.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:35}
Um…

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:00:36}
And asked him if there's any openings. He said they're laying people off. I'm like, oh, that's great. That seems nice.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:42}
He said.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:00:43}
Keep me posted.
reached out to Matt Holmes at, um, Robert Half. He says he's looking out, there's really nothing. He said even the temp jobs are pretty terrible, like, 2 weeks.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:56}
Yeah.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:00:58}
No.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:58}
Um… It's gonna start back picking up.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:01:02}
That's what I'm hearing, like.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:03}
It's the new year, they're with their… yeah, it's gonna start picking up, they're, you know, people, they're letting go of their, uh, temporary staff that they hired for the holidays, and then other people are retiring. So, you know, it's a lot of…

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:01:20}
Things are shuffling around, and, um, it's… it's going to open up really soon.
Yeah. I talked to… I hung out with another friend yesterday who is a… he's a CPA. I asked him, is it worth doing a CPA? He said, honestly, it's, you know, not really worth it unless you want to be an accountant. He said, you know, look… he'll be in… he's in California, but he said, I'll be in New Jersey.
in January, at a partner's meeting, I'll see what we have. He's like, we're not touching anything till January, so… but he said.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:53}
There might be some sad.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:01:54}
accounting.
you know, jobs.
Um, he's like, I'll ask my wife, I had dinner with them, and he's like… or lunch, dinner, I think they call it here.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:05}
Okay. And he's like…

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:02:06}
I'll let you… so everyone's like, I'll let you know, but it's just, like, everything's on pause. I sent a few apps out, but, you know, it's just, like, it's the same… like, the same jobs they've applied for 6 times, you know?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:17}
Right, okay.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:02:19}
So, and then that other… my dad's high school friend from UnitedHealthcare, he sent me some… a new referral. He said, try that one out. He goes, I don't know what the heck's going on.
Well, it is a bit depressing.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:37}
But don't give up. It can be, but don't give up, you know, just… the right door is going to open, I always say that.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:02:46}
Yeah, I mean, it's, it's like, we got plenty of time, it's just my level of.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:51}
of boredom.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:02:52}
It's… is… is weaning, that's the word.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:55}
Yeah.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:02:56}
like, benefits-wise, we're fine, you know? It's more of just my mental state of doing this again, and rinse and repeat every day. I'm just like, ugh, too much.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:03:08}
Right. Two months. Right. Mm-hmm.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:03:10}
And I did, you know, I did get… I'm gonna have by the end of, uh… um, you know, the year mark, I'll have you know, I think that whatever the college limit is to satisfy an audit.
Um, I should have that as well. So, it should be good.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:03:27}
Okay, okay. If anything, so I did…

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:03:29}
Three, three classes.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:03:31}
One more done.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:03:33}
in, uh… by the end of, you know, April.
So just in case… I don't think they're gonna, you know… worry, but…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:03:41}
I'll send that all.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:03:41}
Over to you.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:03:43}
Okay, alright, great.
How was your New Year's, by the way? It was nice, thank you so much for asking. I'm just thankful to still be here, thankful… Yes. Take every… every day as a new blessing, and I'm so appreciative of it.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:04:01}
Yeah. Did you say New York City?
Yes. I… I don't… I never go to the ball drop, so… No, no normal person.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:11}
I think the…

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:04:12}
That's…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:12}
No, I, I… I never go, I never wanted to go, mm-mm, that's not for me.
I've been around it.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:04:20}
One year, when I was, like, 18 or 17.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:22}
I was like, oh, this is…

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:04:23}
Horrible.
Worst experience ever.
And not even then…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:31}
But I haven't eaten too much.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:04:34}
Too much for tourists.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:36}
Yes. It's for tourists and actors, you know? Yes, that's who it's for. I always say that. It's for the tourists. It's not for people that actually live here.
No, not at all. Not at all. Not at all.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:04:50}
Another thing I was gonna try to do, my other tactics, I forgot to…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:53}
Mentioned to you.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:04:54}
I know the associate programs are going to open up, which I.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:57}
I would love to go.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:04:58}
It's gonna be hell, but I'll suck it up.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:05:02}
socio-religious.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:05:02}
Goldman and, you know, Chase would be nice.
You know, the grunt work.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:05:08}
Mhm.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:05:09}
At least it pays well, it's in the city.
Um, and um, that's all opening up.
But I talked to my few contacts at Citibank.
And I looked, they said, we are not even doing any kind of associate hiring at the moment. I was like, really? They want… they're hiring for 3 graduate students and maybe 5 bachelor's students. They're not even doing their 2020.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:05:36}
Associate Program.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:05:37}
I was like, why?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:05:37}
Right. Mm-hmm. Crazy.
Have you, um, looked at any of the apprenticeship programs?

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:05:49}
like, for… Like, like, handwork? Like, blue cross?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:05:54}
dollar stuff?
For any, any, uh-huh.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:05:58}
I'm… I think I'm too blind for that.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:06:01}
Okay. I have enough to drink.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:06:01}
drive, but my, like…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:06:03}
Mm-hmm. You know, folk.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:06:04}
focusing, like… minute tasks, like… like reading texts and a little label. My dad's a… my dad's a jeweler, you know? He's a… he's…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:06:13}
Just sold the family.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:06:14}
business.
He's like, do you think you could… I'm like, I can't even see the watch parts.
Because they're so, like, tiny. So, I don't know. And I'm not supposed to lift a certain amount, and work a half.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:06:26}
Okay.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:06:28}
It's like, I can do it, but I will screw something up, because my, like, my depth of… my right eye is blind, so my depth of field's pretty bad.
They, you know, I don't know how they proved me to drive, and I still don't know.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:06:41}
Mm-hmm, okay. That can seem far.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:06:44}
away, but, like, close-up stuff.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:06:46}
I don't know, I can see…

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:06:46}
I thought about, you know, going to my SBA and seeing if I could start some kind of, like, you know, I used to have a long time ago coffee company.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:06:55}
Right. The kind of coffee.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:06:56}
business.
So I'm gonna talk to my small little SBA in town and see if there's any grants that they can apply for, at least.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:03}
That would be something exactly.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:07:04}
to work on while I'm looking for a job?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:06}
Better than nothing. Right. It won't make…

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:07:09}
Make income for a while at the…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:11}
You know, go to the pharmacy.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:07:12}
markets, it's a whole process, but that'd be a.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:15}
Right.
Right, right, right.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:07:18}
You know how it is in New Jersey, New York, I have to get an EPA.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:22}
regulation…

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:07:23}
Hmm.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:24}
M.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:07:24}
pollution stuff.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:26}
It's a lot of paper.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:07:27}
paperwork, so…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:28}
Right.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:07:29}
Boom. Okay.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:31}
We'll just keep… I'm trying.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:07:33}
That'd be great.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:34}
I know you were! Mental, mental has been so mental.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:07:38}
Um, and I went through the list, every… everything was in Illinois, like…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:43}
No, there… most of those, they're… most of those are national, so when you click on it, it will show you probably the last place where I was looking for something for someone, so you just click on it, and you… Click your area.
Like, where it says location.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:08:03}
Nothing.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:04}
Didn't have anything in New York, or nothing in… I don't know if you could get, like, what… Closer, PA is to you.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:08:11}
BA's too far east, that's…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:13}
Okay. New York City.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:08:13}
But I went through it all. It's stuff that… there's stuff.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:16}
worth it.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:08:17}
like, you know, generative AI engineer, like, I have way.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:21}
way above my…

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:08:22}
you know, scope. The ones that.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:23}
We're in the city.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:08:24}
All the stuff outside the city.
food manufacturing manager, and every… it was either out of my scope, like, not in my profession, even if I.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:34}
Where to reach…

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:08:35}
terrain. It would take years.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:38}
Um, and the others.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:08:39}
definitely side of this… like, I did New Jersey, and I also did the remote button.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:42}
It went one by one.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:08:44}
Um, nothing really there.
Um, went down the list.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:50}
I'm surprised.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:08:51}
Damn.
There's a few I applied for in that list, maybe 3, but the rest of them were just, like… I don't know, and give you a report about it, but it was just, like, it was all, like, not… either in…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:09:02}
Not in the area.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:09:03}
was mainly the issue. It was all in the middle.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:09:05}
some of this stuff, but…

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:09:08}
Walmart had, like, part-time stuff, but it wasn't even… in the area.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:09:13}
Which is interesting.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:09:14}
There was one Walmart roll I saw, but I didn't have the credentials, like, they wanted 5 years of SQL, and I was like, it'd be so nice. I don't have 5 years of SQL.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:09:25}
wine.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:09:28}
I didn't know… we still use SQL.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:09:31}
Oh, I don't even know what that is.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:09:34}
Because I barely noted it.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:09:37}
She used it, basically.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:09:39}
So…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:09:40}
Like, little things.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:09:41}
I'll throw in there, like, 4 years of Python, you know?
It's not even a data job, and you're like, what?
So it's… I'll still apply, I'm like, you know?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:09:51}
date.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:09:52}
Yeah.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:09:54}
Yeah.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:09:55}
I'm on.
That's… that's the dew.
That's…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:09:59}
Yeah. All right, well, just keep me updated, and we'll keep doing our check-ins. And if you see anything, I'll let you know.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:10:08}
Yeah, hopefully this friend from the accounting firm can get me some staff accounting job.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:10:14}
virtually, instead of.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:10:15}
I'm waiting for to hear back.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:10:17}
Okay. So, he'll be in Jersey.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:10:19}
The two weeks from now?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:10:21}
Oh, nice, okay.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:10:22}
If you see the CEO, or you see one of your partners, just ask them.
Right. I happily do that. It's boring work, it's…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:10:31}
Mentally does.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:10:33}
But it's work. It's still… it's easy, you know, just filing people's taxes.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:10:37}
Right.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:10:39}
This is boring.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:10:40}
This is very boring.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:10:41}
But… We'll see.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:10:45}
Okay. Hmm.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:10:47}
Yeah, I'll keep you posted.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:10:49}
Okay.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:10:51}
Okie dokie.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:10:52}
Alright. Do you want me to…

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:10:54}
Catch base in 2 weeks, or, you know, what do you… what's easiest?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:10:57}
for ya.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:10:58}
I'm peace.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:10:59}
Once a month is… is… Whenever you… I mean, you send me your emails, and then whenever you're ready, you know, whenever I have something, I'll let you know.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:11:09}
Okie dokie, sounds good to me.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:11:12}
Okay.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:11:14}
Talks.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:11:15}
Okay, then. Bye-bye.

[Nathan Kalupa] {00:11:17}
Mm, cool.

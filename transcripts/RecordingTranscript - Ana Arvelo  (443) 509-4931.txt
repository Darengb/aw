Hello, Mr. Boyd.
Okay, one moment, please. Um…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:25}
Mr. Moore, are you interested in Ticket to Work?

[(443) 509-4931] {00:00:29}
Yes, ma'am.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:31}
Okay. Let's see here… Great, great, great. So, I see you've called, uh, we've spoken… well, not with me, but you've spoken to one of our colleagues in the past about, um, Ticket to Work?
Yeah. Hi, sir, so let me just ask you a few questions, since this was in 2024, let me just get some updated information. Um, Gary, do you still live in Baltimore?

[(443) 509-4931] {00:00:58}
Yes.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:59}
Yes, okay.
And, um, are you on SSI or SSDI?

[(443) 509-4931] {00:01:05}
That's supposed to be, uh…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:06}
SSDI, okay. And have you worked within the last 5 years?

[(443) 509-4931] {00:01:10}
No, ma'am.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:14}
Okay, has not worked… When was the last time you were employed?

[(443) 509-4931] {00:01:19}
I think it was in the last 5 years. I had a job for, like, uh, 3 months with, uh, Floor & Decor.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:27}
Um, with whom?

[(443) 509-4931] {00:01:29}
So that was, like, uh…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:31}
2022.

[(443) 509-4931] {00:01:32}
Richie, man.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:33}
Okay, gotcha.
Okay, and what kind of work are you looking for now?

[(443) 509-4931] {00:01:39}
Um, I got experience in forklift operator in Florida.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:45}
Okay, perfect. Operator, and… alright.
And do you have any certifications for that?

[(443) 509-4931] {00:01:55}
Yes, ma'am?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:57}
Awesome. Alright, and have you been looking, um, for employment on your own right now, or, um… Yes, ma'am, I've been looking.

[(443) 509-4931] {00:02:06}
phone, calling her, but nobody's been calling me back. I went to temporary agencies and everything.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:02:10}
Oh, my goodness.

[(443) 509-4931] {00:02:12}

[Ana Arvelo] {00:02:14}
Yeah, okay. And nobody called me back. No one called you back. Okay, that was…

[(443) 509-4931] {00:02:20}
nation.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:02:22}
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir. Um, are you within 18 to 64 years old? Ticket to work is up to 64.

[(443) 509-4931] {00:02:29}
I'm gonna turn 65 Monday.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:02:32}
Oh, you're already 64.

[(443) 509-4931] {00:02:35}
Yeah, I turned 65 Monday.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:02:37}
Monday. Oh, happy early birthday. Um, so unfortunately, um, Mr. Moore, uh, so Ticket to Work is up to 64, so we wouldn't be able to enroll you, unfortunately.

[(443) 509-4931] {00:02:50}
Okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:02:51}
Yeah, my apologies about that. No, of course, thank you for giving us a call, and best of luck on your search. Wait, before you go, Mr. Armore. One second, hello? I want to provide you with a resource before you hang up. Yeah, I want to give you something to, um… I don't know if you've ever looked at your job… your state jobs bank?
like, every state has a job bank, um, that you could look through, so I want to make sure to, uh, email you that so that can help on your job search. Um, at least want to leave you with that. Okay, thanks. Yes, of course. Is your email still GARYMSR0 at gmail.com?

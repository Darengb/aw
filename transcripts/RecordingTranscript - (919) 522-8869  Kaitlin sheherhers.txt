Hello?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:02}
Hi, this is Kaitlin with America Works, and I was calling about, uh, the Ticket to Work program, which is a Social Security program. Am I speaking with David?

[(919) 522-8869] {00:00:09}
This is him.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:11}
Are you familiar with the Ticket to Work program?

[(919) 522-8869] {00:00:14}
No.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:15}
So, it is a program for SSI or SSDI beneficiaries who are interested in returning to work full-time. Is that something that might interest you?

[(919) 522-8869] {00:00:25}
Uh, yeah, it might.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:27}
Excellent. So, the, um, program, it's free and it's voluntary. It's run either by employment networks, like America Works, um, where I'm calling from, um, or vocational rehab agencies, which are, um, state, uh, run agencies, though they are
Though we both do run the Ticket to Work program, we do it a little differently. Because Evoke Rehab is a state agency, they have additional grants and funding for workforce development, and they tend to work with individuals for a shorter amount of time, about a year, whereas an employment network, um, doesn't have the same funding for education, though we do have weekly free webinars.
Um, we work with individuals for a longer amount of time, so we work with folks even once they start working. Um, the things we do are we help, um, individuals navigate, um, Social Security's, uh, work incentives.
So they know how and when their benefits should change based on income.
Um, we help with job development, so things like Creating resumes, helping with your job search, job search strategy, um, applications, helping prepare for interviews.
Um… What day of the month do you receive your benefits?

[(919) 522-8869] {00:01:43}
Um, it's like the third week of…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:45}
The third week? Okay, so that would mean that you're on SSDI, and the reason I bring that up is because it's, um, different for SSI versus SSDI. So, with SSDI, you get something called, uh, 9 months of trial work level.
Um, and what that means is that if you start working and you make over $1,210 in 2026, um, it counts as one of your trial work-level months. Um, what that means is that you get to keep your income and your benefits for that month, and you get 9 of them.
But say that job doesn't work out, and the second month, you don't make over $1,210. That wouldn't be a trial work-level month.
Um, but you would still only have 8 left.
Once you have hit 9 trial work level months, if you're making over, um, $1,690 a month, your benefits should then go into suspense, and you should go into something called, um, the extended period of eligibility. So you would still get your benefits for 3 more months, regardless of your income, um, and then they would go into suspense.
And that would be good, because you wouldn't want to get an overpayment, or have Social Security, you know, request for the money back. Um… And the extended period of eligibility is a 36-month period where if you had to stop working for any reason, you'd be able to just have your benefits turned back on pretty, pretty quickly. It might take a month or two, but generally pretty quickly.
the 36 months, you would then graduate the Ticket to Work program, and um…
at that point, you'd get a letter from Social Security saying, you know, you no longer are on disability. However, you'd want to hold on to that, because 5 years from that date, um, you could request expedited reinstatement. So, what that means is if you had to stop working due to your disability, or health…
disability-related health issue, um, you could ask for expedited reinstatement, and Social Security would turn your cash benefits back on while they reviewed your case. Um, and then you're… assuming they approve it, then you'd be back on disability. Um, but then you wouldn't be able to work for a two-year period after that.
Um… You also are eligible for Medicare, um.
Regardless of your income, Medicare Part A, um, for 93 consecutive months, once your benefits go into suspense, and you would be eligible still for Part B and Part D, assuming, um, you were enrolled, and that would be based on your income, and you were paying premiums. Um, is this something that could interest you?

[(919) 522-8869] {00:04:25}
Uh, sounds like a lot of information to digest.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:04:28}
It is. We do have an upcoming webinar, though, next Friday.
Um, where it's like a, um, like an information session where.
Um, like, my supervisor gives a presentation, and it's all online, it's, you know.
It goes over all the work incentives, and then there's a question and answer session.

[(919) 522-8869] {00:04:50}
I guess maybe I'd be interested in that.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:04:53}
I sent you an email two days ago, um, or on December 30th, sorry, a few days ago, labeled, Looking for Work, and in there is the link to register for the webinar.
And there's also additional information in there, along with all of my contact info.
Um, would you be interested in me giving you a call?

[(919) 522-8869] {00:05:15}
To follow up after the webinar?
Yeah, that's fine. Um, I don't know if I got the email, I haven't, uh… it may have went in my spam folder.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:05:25}
Mayo, is your email dwitcombd at aol.com?

[(919) 522-8869] {00:05:31}
Yes, it is.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:05:32}
It is, okay. Um, I can definitely resend it, um… But it is labeled, looking for work.
Um, so I would, I would definitely check your spam folder or junk folder, um, but let's see here, let me forward this to you again. I'm also going to include a pamphlet called, um, Working While Disabled, and that outlines Social Security's, um.
work incentives. It's a Social Security pamphlet, and it just, um… the information that would be relevant to you would be on pages 1 through 6, because it would be the SSDI work incentives.

[(919) 522-8869] {00:06:05}
Okay.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:06:06}
Alright, let me… on here, and I will make a note to myself to call you back. And again, my name's Kaitlin Ford, um, and AmericaWorks is the name of the, um, employment network that I'm calling from.

[(919) 522-8869] {00:06:18}
Okay, that sounds great.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:06:20}
Alright, well, you have a really great rest of your day, and Happy New Year!

[(919) 522-8869] {00:06:25}
Alright, thank you, Kaitlin.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:06:26}
You're welcome. Bye now.

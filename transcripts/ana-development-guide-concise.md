# Development Guide for Ana Arvelo

## Your Development Goals

You've been identified as someone with high potential. This guide will help you move from excellent service to transformational coaching.

### Why This Matters

Many clients stay on disability not because they *can't* work, but because they lack confidence. Our role is to help them see possibilities—and your ability to create vision, build narratives, and challenge gently is what moves clients from "I can't" to "I can." That's how placements happen.

| Goal | What It Looks Like |
|------|-------------------|
| **Vision Creator** | Help clients see their future selves |
| **Narrative Builder** | Transform information into inspiring stories |
| **Gentle Challenger** | Balance validation with accountability |
| **Celebration Champion** | Help clients feel proud of their progress |
| **Full Ownership** | Handle all conversations with confidence |

## Your Strengths

**Professional Communication**: Your greeting and manner set the right tone every call.

**Client Comfort**: You make clients feel safe asking questions and exploring options.

**Bilingual Service**: You expand program access by serving Spanish-speaking clients.

## Building Toward Your Goals

### 1. Vision Creator: Ask Bigger Questions

**Instead of** starting with logistics ("When can we schedule?")

**Try opening with**: "What do you see yourself doing in 5 years? What kind of work excites you?"

*Big questions help clients see you as a guide to their future, not just someone handling paperwork.*

---

### 2. Narrative Builder: Create Their Story

**Instead of** just taking notes

**Try reading back**: "Here's what I'm hearing about your goals: You're rebuilding your career strategically—using this job to demonstrate reliability while keeping your health a priority. Your plan is to gain experience here, then transition to something with better pay and benefits. Does that capture it?"

*When clients hear their story told professionally, they see themselves differently.*

---

### 3. Gentle Challenger: Add Accountability

**Instead of** only validating ("That counts for something, absolutely.")

**Try adding**: "You're rebuilding your work experience—that's huge. What's one thing you can do this month to prepare for that next step?"

**Other phrases**:
- "You have to be ready for when that opportunity comes."
- "That's a great goal. Have you started researching what it takes?"

*Supportive validation feels good. Gentle challenge helps clients grow. Do both.*

---

### 4. Celebration Champion: Elevate Wins

**Instead of** acknowledging ("Oh, man, okay.")

**Try reframing**: "I hear you—the benefits aren't great. But here's what I'm excited about: you're working, you're building history, and we're going to use this as a stepping stone."

**For good news**: "Oh, congratulations! That's a real milestone. You should be proud."

*Clients often don't see their own progress. Your enthusiasm makes it real.*

---

### 5. Full Ownership: Be the Expert

**Instead of** deferring ("My manager Cynthia can explain this in more detail.")

**Try owning it**: "Let me walk you through exactly how this transition works. By the end of this call, you'll know exactly where you stand."

*You already know the material. Own the conversation.*

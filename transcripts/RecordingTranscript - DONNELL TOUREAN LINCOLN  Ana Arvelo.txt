[DONNELL TOUREAN LINCOLN] {00:00:00}
Hello?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:03}
Hello, Mr. Lincoln, this is Anna from America Works. I'm sorry I missed your call. How are you?

[DONNELL TOUREAN LINCOLN] {00:00:08}
I was calling to just let you know, I, um, I am still looking… well, Happy New… Happy New Year's to you first. Happy New Year's.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:17}
Happy New Year's! Happy New Year's to you both!

[DONNELL TOUREAN LINCOLN] {00:00:22}
I am… I'm… I'm still looking for jobs.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:25}
Hmm, I'm…

[DONNELL TOUREAN LINCOLN] {00:00:26}
looking for part-time work so I can keep my stuff on, because I know if I do go full-time, they're gonna… They're gonna cut it off, and it's gonna be hard for me to get back on. Get it back on.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:42}
So, um, I am…

[DONNELL TOUREAN LINCOLN] {00:00:44}
looking for a part-time, so I can work.
5 hours, and plus still get my Social Security.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:51}
Okay, so the one thing about that, and that's fine, um, Mr. Lincoln, the only thing is that with our program, you have to be looking for full-time to be able to, um, be working with AmeriCorps. Um, and also the goal is to get off of your benefits in the long term.
But if that doesn't align with you, what I can do is refer you to your local state vocational rehabilitation, because they can help you find a part-time.

[DONNELL TOUREAN LINCOLN] {00:01:16}
Yeah…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:18}
I know, uh… I'm not…

[DONNELL TOUREAN LINCOLN] {00:01:20}
With my sickness, they're not gonna take.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:23}
That'd be awful.

[DONNELL TOUREAN LINCOLN] {00:01:24}
of my stuff.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:25}
I gotcha.

[DONNELL TOUREAN LINCOLN] {00:01:27}
That's why I'd rather just go ahead and look.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:29}
Mm-hmm. For…

[DONNELL TOUREAN LINCOLN] {00:01:30}
Fair enough.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:31}
Damn.

[DONNELL TOUREAN LINCOLN] {00:01:32}
Or, um, go back to full bill of oil, and, um…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:37}
Mm-hmm. Do such…

[DONNELL TOUREAN LINCOLN] {00:01:38}
The 7.5, because that's not, um, really full-time work.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:44}
Hmm.
Okay, so then, um, let me connect you to your local location. Just give me one second, so I can get you their information, so you can call them and set an appointment with your… have you ever worked with the local vocational in your state?

[DONNELL TOUREAN LINCOLN] {00:02:02}
Yeah, I know where it's at. It's not too far from where.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:02:06}
Oh, it is closed, yeah.

[DONNELL TOUREAN LINCOLN] {00:02:09}
Yeah, because they could, they're down in the Southwest, so…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:02:12}
It was tough with, so…

[DONNELL TOUREAN LINCOLN] {00:02:13}
Ashley Walk.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:02:15}
Yeah, it says here it's 1.9 miles, and it's on, uh, 15th Street, Northeast 9th floor.

[DONNELL TOUREAN LINCOLN] {00:02:22}
Yeah.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:02:23}
Yeah, I'm still gonna email you the information, so you have it. Um, so what will happen next is I will have to de-assign your ticket with us, so they can work with you, because we both can't work with you at the same time.
And that's okay, it happens sometimes. You're welcome. You know, we just do what's best for you, the client, right? So I'll go ahead and, um, email you that.

[DONNELL TOUREAN LINCOLN] {00:02:43}
Okay, thanks.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:02:45}
Brahman, have a great rest of your day, and year, and your journey. Best of luck.

[DONNELL TOUREAN LINCOLN] {00:02:51}
Thanks for reaching out. You're welcome. Bye now. Okay. Bye.

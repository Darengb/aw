[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:00:01}
Hello?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:02}
Hello, John. Happy New Year. How are you?

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:00:06}
Doing alright, how are you?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:07}
I'm doing well, thank you so much. I was just calling to return your missed calls. We were playing phone tag for a little bit.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:00:15}
Oh, yeah.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:16}
Yeah, yeah.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:00:18}
Well, um, I don't know if you got my message or not, but…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:22}
I did, yes. Mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:00:24}
Pay stunts, okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:27}
you got paid, but you, um, you didn't get the stubs today, though, right? That'll be Monday. Monday. Okay, not a problem. Don't worry about that.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:00:36}
except for the last check, because it was… It was supposed to be paid on Thursday, which was yesterday, but because of the holiday, they paid it out on the 31st, so it will fall on September.
Got it.
But, I still didn't make enough.
make the threshold.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:57}
Oh, okay.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:00:59}
Now, I had a question on that, too.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:01}
Sure.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:01:02}
She had a minute to answer it.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:05}
Mhm, I'll try my best.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:01:07}
Now, that threshold is $1,000, $1,000 and some odd dollars, right?
You said after I had met those thresholds for the, uh, income.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:20}
The threshold, um, for 2026 is 1,210.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:01:26}
Okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:27}
Now…

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:01:29}
Now, if I… well, that, of course, that question to be answered for first.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:35}
Um.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:01:37}
that I would have to make $15, $26, If I made below that amount.
Does that still mean I get my Social Security?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:50}
That's correct. Yeah, if you make below the amount, um, after the trial work period, the… for 2026, it has gone up to $16.90. If you make more than that after the trial work period, I know that you have some months left, but after that's done, yeah, you will… if you earn under that amount, you still get your pay.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:02:12}
Okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:02:14}
Nope.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:02:14}
And that was my question, cause I…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:02:16}
That's that one.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:02:17}
I didn't know if I didn't make… because I'm not quite making 1526, but I think I'm making over, uh…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:02:27}
I'm taking at least 1210, because that's the amount, um, for the month to count. It's a 1,210 trial work level.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:02:36}
Oh, I didn't do… I didn't make that much stuff for December. Absolutely not. I made, uh… $500, a little over $550.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:02:45}
Okay, okay.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:02:46}
That checks one should be… Yeah, that makes sense. So it should be about a little under 7. Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But January, you know.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:03:04}
Mmm, so that should make it.
If… if you work the… probably the, uh, full amount of time. Mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:03:12}
So… So, the two-week… so, like, I won't have two checks coming in this month, which.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:03:20}
Technically.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:03:22}
Because they faded from the 31st.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:03:25}
June.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:03:25}
only wanting two.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:03:27}
Huh?

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:03:28}
Now, I'll still make the trial period.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:03:31}
Mhm. But…

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:03:33}
It would probably be under that 1526.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:03:37}
Yeah, and that's okay, that 1526 starts to count, um, once you're done with the trial work period. Okay. Yeah, that counts later.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:03:47}
Yes.
Now… Later on, let's say if I make… uh, site.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:03:56}
Hm? Yes.
Yeah, yeah.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:04:00}
by last year's numbers. I know it's going up.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:02}
I've got plans.
So if that makes up…

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:04:07}
Say if I make 15 cents.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:10}
Is that…

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:04:11}
Going over the amount of…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:13}
No, because the amount is, uh, $16.90, and then you… yeah, then your benefit would be suspended once you start earning more than $16.90.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:04:24}
Okay, so if I made $1,700… Okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:29}
Right, correct.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:04:31}
So…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:32}
Mhm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:04:34}
So, if I don't make over… okay, so, yeah, so mainly… so basically, once I've… so if I've got my… if I'm thinking… so, let me see if I got my thinking correct.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:46}
Mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:04:47}
Once I've got past I'll work 3 to 1,000.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:52}
Yeah.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:04:55}
get into that, where I'm actually in the… They're watching my pay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:05:01}
Yeah, it's called the Extended Period of Eligibility. Mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:05:05}
So, if I'm in that extended period of eligibility, and I am not making that 1629.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:05:13}
1690. Mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:05:15}
8 nights.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:05:16}
Yeah.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:05:17}
I'm not making that threshold.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:05:24}
You continue to receive your pay, yeah.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:05:26}
Okay. Yep.
That's what I was curious about.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:05:31}
Yeah, you get that.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:05:32}
that, let's say through… after I… let's say if I hit it in February and March.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:05:38}
Mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:05:39}
Dollar Farm.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:05:41}
Mhm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:05:42}
that trial period. I know I'm going over a lot of scenarios here.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:05:45}
No, these are all very excellent questions, and I encourage you to keep asking, though, though. Yes, please go ahead.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:05:52}
because I'm budgeting this in my head, too, just to see what I need to plan and get to. Exactly. So, if, say, it's February and March.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:06:04}
Hypothetically.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:06:05}
I'm like… that trial period.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:06:07}
Mm-hmm. Okay.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:06:08}
That one can, uh, work.
Periods that weren't… I'm sorry, don't… I keep messing up.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:06:15}
No, it's okay. So the trial work period is 9 months, then you get, um, a transition month, it's called the cessation month, right? Then you get 2 grace periods, so, um, it's a total of 12.
Yeah. And then after that, yeah, you're in the extended. The extended technically starts right when you get those three, um, grace period months, like, at the beginning of that. Mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:06:43}
Let's say in February and March, I make those two months that.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:06:49}
Mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:06:51}
In that test period.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:06:53}
Mhm, mhm. So…

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:06:55}
That would be, uh, April.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:06:59}
Mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:07:00}
make 15… if I make below that 16…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:07:04}
90, 90, boom.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:07:07}
80 that month.
Would I still get a check in?
Would that still carry over into May? Would I still be getting that check in May?
Oh, I see what you're asking. Yeah, so if in April you hit the $16.90, then May you would not get the pay. Even if it's under a dollar, you'll still get it.
So, say if I made $6 Let's say I made $16.50.
and…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:07:44}
That's below the threshold. That's below substantial gainful, yeah. Even if you make 1689.99… That's below the threshold.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:07:55}
And then I would get the full check, or would it be minus what?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:08:01}
I'm sorry?

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:08:02}
So, would it be that?
Or would it be minus whatever the… whatever the… whatever my payroll would be?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:08:12}
Oh, um, okay, yeah, the whole… you wouldn't get any payment from Social Security if you are above the threshold.
1690, yeah.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:08:25}
that said if I made $1,500 after that.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:08:28}
I know.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:08:30}
Let's say if I make $1,500, I would still, in May.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:08:35}
Mm-hmm. You'd still be under. Mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:08:38}
so that I would still be able to get my Social Security check.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:08:43}
Yes.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:08:44}
Okay, that's what I was trying to get at.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:08:46}
Okay, okay.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:08:48}
So I knew where I was standing at, because I didn't know if they were just gonna cut me off cold turkey. No, it's a transition period. That's why you get the 3-month grace period, right? Because that helps you transition. Yeah.
And below that.
1590 threshold.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:09:07}
Exactly. Yeah, you haven't reached what is called… yeah, you haven't reached, um, substantial gainful activity. Mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:09:15}
I just wanted to make sure if that was the…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:09:18}
That's the old one.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:09:19}
Okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:09:20}
No, that's right. That is still the case.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:09:23}
So if I still make… so, because I know that the… Trial work.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:09:28}
It's flat.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:09:29}
And what the threshold is.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:09:32}
Mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:09:34}
I know I'll probably get it… one of the trial periods will end.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:09:42}
Yes.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:09:42}
February…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:09:44}
Right?

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:09:46}
Goodbye.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:09:46}
Right.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:09:47}
So if I will make more than that $16.90.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:09:51}
Right. That's where I'm at.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:09:54}
Right now. That's why I was trying to figure out to where I need to… went, how I need to budget.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:09:59}
Right, and that's what you should be thinking about, absolutely, especially during you being so close to the transition time, yes. And we still have to schedule your benefits counseling meeting, um, with my manager, Cynthia, because, um, it'll help even clarify this even more, because she could check you in the… because you sent us your benefits planning query, but she can check you in the portal to see if those documents actually
And, uh, to have a conversation with you on how to transition forward, okay? So, um, I need to still schedule ya, so let me look at the… let me look at her calendar.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:10:34}
I don't have.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:10:35}
I mean.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:10:36}
off until probably February… actually, my last day, I would have off would be February the 13th would be my next day.
treatment status.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:10:47}
That will be yesterday.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:10:47}
I would have off.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:10:49}
Okay. That's a Friday. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:10:52}
Now, I would not, uh, the treatment does not necessarily, uh.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:10:59}
April clip.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:10:59}
I'm able to pretty well function, it's just…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:11:02}
Pretty much in all places.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:11:03}
Thanks.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:11:04}
Okay.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:11:05}
I usually get out about this time, too.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:11:08}
Mhm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:11:09}
so that way I can, uh, be able to.
um… I'll be able to discuss that with… While I'm… Okay. Mm-hmm. Do you, uh, what time is your appointment?
My appointment generally is around, uh, it's generally around, uh, 10 o'clock.
Mm-hmm. So… uh… So, I'm usually driving to that appointment between.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:11:41}
I think so.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:11:42}
Excellent.
Yeah. And… but I can still talk, I just can't take any kind of notes.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:11:51}
Yeah, no, it's better that you, um, take notes, though, so maybe we can schedule you for later in the day, so that way, um, you're able to take your notes and focus, yeah.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:12:03}
get home.
Between 3 and 4 o'clock, if that's not too late.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:12:10}
No. Well, let me see, you're an hour behind us. No, I'm in…

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:12:14}
Eastern Time.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:12:16}
You're in Eastern Time? Oh, you're not in, um…

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:12:18}
No, I'm not… I'm on Eastern.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:12:21}
Oh, you are in Eastern Time, okay. I gotcha. Wait, is your address still, um… Uh, 164 Old Johnson Road. Cleveland. Cleveland, Tennessee, okay. I put in, uh, something wrong. Okay, good, so Eastern Standard, so we are good on that note. Yeah, 3 or 4 o'clock is not too late, because we close at, um, 5 o'clock Eastern Standard Time, so that should be okay.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:12:46}
I would gear it more towards smaller participation.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:12:49}
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:12:52}
It's not too late.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:12:54}
Yeah, I cannot run it by my manager. Let me look at her calendar. Um, she works… she does work, um, Fridays, um, she works remote, but she should have availability. I'm gonna open her calendar and see what I see.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:13:09}
Okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:13:10}
Yeah, her day is pretty much open the 13th. Yeah, so we can do 4 o'clock… so February 13th, 4 o'clock Eastern Standard Time, tentatively. You know, in case you need to change it or anything like that, you can always reach back out. And that'll be your benefits counseling session, in which all the questions you ask me, you can re-ask her, um, and go over your transition from the trial work period
To the extended period of eligibility.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:13:37}
Because that was a spot that was vague to me, because I was I understand, because that was vague to me anyway, whenever, even when I took Social Security.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:13:48}
Because they were…

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:13:49}
telling me that the threshold was, like, that $1,500 or $1,600, but then they said I could only make, like, they said the thread… the… the… that work trial period was, like, $1,000. I said, wait a minute.
It's gone up every year. Yeah, it goes up. Well, I mean, I'm just going from last year's numbers. Oh, last year, 1,160. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But that's the numbers I had memorized, so…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:14:16}
Mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:14:17}
A whole other set of numbers, but…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:14:19}
Right. Mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:14:21}
But the, uh, assist that… Uh, but because of that, I was thinking that, you know, they said, they said the amount I would make before I would lose my benefits was, like, $1,500.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:14:39}
Gotcha.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:14:40}
And that was where I was like, confused.
So that was where it was kind of vague. Got it.
But, I think… I think I understand now, just as long as I don't make over that amount.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:14:53}
Mm-hmm. Don't come on.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:14:55}
I might make for it, and sometimes I may not. If I don't, Then… I don't know. We'll go from there to see what happens.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:15:03}
Mhm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:15:04}
I just wanted to make sure if after that 2 trial periods, I wasn't getting cut off cold turkey.
to budget myself.
Cause I was not sure on that.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:15:17}
Right, that's correct. Mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:15:19}
I understand I need to… I know.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:15:21}
and…

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:15:22}
It's gonna be something that they are gonna take away, but…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:15:26}
I just wanted to prep, yeah. No, and I think, um, you are absolutely right in starting to think about this, and when you meet with my manager, Cynthia Wilson, she will be able to go over that more in detail.
I just put you in, yeah.
Mm-hmm, let's see, let me make sure to put in your appointment, uh, benefits counseling meeting with Cynthia and John.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:15:59}
Okay.
I'll put myself in there, too. I want to listen in. That way, you know, I can also take notes on how it went.
Yeah. So, that kind of… that kind of paired up some things I had questions about, and…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:16:18}
And, uh…

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:16:19}
Uh, if I'm… if I know as long as I'm not making over that 60 and 29 now.
for a month.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:16:28}
Yeah, uh, so right now, because you're not in the extended period yet, right now, you have to hit the 1,210. That's called the trial work level, right? Because you're still in the trial work period, and then once you're in the extended period of eligibility, 1,690.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:16:47}
Yeah.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:16:48}
I haven't hit that.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:16:49}
No, not yet. I didn't get it last month, and I probably… I don't think I'm gonna get it this month here. I understand. What I'm seeing so far, I don't know if this is going to be a very high-paying job.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:17:06}
Oh, I see. Okay, we'll have to see. Yeah, we'll keep an eye on that. Mm-hmm. And if you're needing to adjust, um, want to look for something else, you can always reach out, and we can… I can send you some more job leads, um, that's something else we can… we'll just play it by ear and see, okay? You just keep me posted.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:17:24}
But this is, if anything, this is just showing… getting my foot back in the door, kind of, sort of thing.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:17:31}
Mhm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:17:32}
The only… the only upside to this place.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:17:36}
Is that it?

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:17:37}
Works with me for doctor's appointments.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:17:40}
And I know that was something you were concerned about, yeah. Yeah, there's not…

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:17:44}
not really any, uh, friends benefits to this job. There's no.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:17:47}
Boom.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:17:49}
This place is bare minimum.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:17:51}
Oh, man, okay.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:17:53}
There's no, uh, paid vacation, no.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:17:56}
Uh…

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:17:57}
no, uh… No, uh, the brakes is unpaid, I mean, the.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:18:03}
Bunch of stuff.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:18:04}
So…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:18:05}
I see.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:18:06}
Yeah, so, I mean, I mean, other than it being a paycheck, that's the only thing it really is.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:18:13}
And, like I said.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:18:14}
to get me that experience. Well, not.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:18:17}
Experience, but…

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:18:18}
at least showing…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:18:19}
Something, yes.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:18:21}
Because I've been out of work for 2 years.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:18:24}
You're rebuilding your work, um, your work activity, yeah, work experience. That counts for something, absolutely.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:18:33}
Be friends for a little while, and then…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:18:36}
I was thinking.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:18:37}
I'm staying with here at least maybe a year to two years.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:18:41}
A year and a half.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:18:42}
I don't know how long you and I will be working, hopefully we'll be… During that time, still working together, but…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:18:49}
Oh, we will, absolutely. I'm still here for the duration of the trial work period. I'm here during the extended period of eligibility. Oh, we're here till, you know, the program's course runs out.
So, um, no, as long as I'm still here and we work together, like, that's fine. As long as we continue to communicate, at least on a monthly basis, we will continue to work together, yeah.
Because that's what.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:19:11}
I've got to do. I've… I'm… I'm thinking… Cause it's more… I mean, I like…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:16}
How many hours?

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:19:17}
Good.
But, I mean…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:20}
Is that something?

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:19:20}
The only thing about it, I mean, the pay is not the.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:23}
best.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:19:24}
$13 an hour.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:25}
Right. It's not the best. Mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:19:28}
be making more.
not the best, so, I mean…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:32}
Unless it works.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:19:34}
performance.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:35}
Right, right.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:19:36}
So, until then…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:38}
I'm gonna give it…

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:19:39}
I'm gonna work, hopefully, the rest of this year.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:42}
Mm-hmm. And then… Lord willing, yup. Mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:19:46}
That, Lord, when the creek don't rise, or if they don't…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:50}
Alright, let me stop.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:19:51}
Something a little bit.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:51}
more successful.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:19:52}
actual.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:53}
Mhm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:19:55}
then, uh, then we will look for something else. Now, I'm not telling them that.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:20:00}
Oh, this is your internal plan. Absolutely.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:20:06}
Uh, you're kind of my guru right now.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:20:09}
Yes. Yes.
Confidante and guru and guide, yes. Yep, we're here to brainstorm together. No, absolutely. You know, I'll just keep what you mentioned as, like, a note in the back of my head, as well as a note in your file, just so… because we're going to have an ongoing conversation about how your employment's going. It's… that's a month-to-month. That's why we speak on a month-to-month basis, because things change.
So, um, I am here for… All of the…

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:20:35}
the whole process. Now, would you recommend, if there's not really any kind of increase in pay or anything like that, would you say a year would be a good…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:20:45}
fridge.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:20:46}
What?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:20:47}
Do you request an increase in pay?

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:20:49}
Well, I mean, as far as to say if there's nothing there, if there's nothing…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:20:54}
IRE.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:20:55}
Kind of benefits, as far as.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:20:57}
Yo.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:20:58}
We get out of there this year.
More, um, it's more substantial.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:21:03}
I would say 6 months to a year. It's reasonable, yeah. And it doesn't hurt to look, right? You could say, you know, let's see how it goes, and whenever you're open to looking, it doesn't hurt to look at job opportunities. I could send you some job leads.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:21:23}
I got a feeling it may get a little better here next year.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:21:26}
Oh, yeah. There you go. That's the whole…

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:21:29}
It's fixing to.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:21:30}
I hope. I hope so, too. Yes.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:21:35}
So, and then, obviously, with that then, I would be making more than the threshold.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:21:39}
Both of them. Both of them, yes, yes.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:21:43}
Alright, well, thanks for touching base with me, and…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:21:48}
Of course!

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:21:50}
Like I said, I'll have those pay stubs to you Monday. I'll have to turn them into Social Security, too.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:21:55}
That's correct, yeah. Would you like me to also send them on your behalf, when you send it to me?

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:22:00}
You can, if you would like, if you would…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:22:02}
I don't mind at all. It's part of what we do. Absolutely. And we send a letter, um, saying, please, to send you a letter back saying that they've confirmed that they received it. So, happy to do so. Mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:22:15}
Fortunately, the only thing I can do is take pictures, because I don't have a scanner.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:22:19}
That's okay. You can take a picture, as long as it's legible. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:22:23}
Yep, that's alright. But this month, I'll only have two.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:22:28}
Okay. Yeah.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:22:30}
for… this'll be for December.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:22:32}
For December. Yeah, that makes sense. That's quite alright. Mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:22:36}
So… Okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:22:38}
wool.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:22:39}
Alright, well, is there anything else you need from me, or any…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:22:43}
No, I think we're good at this point, you know, you updated me about where you're at, when the pay subs are coming, we discussed wage reporting, we discussed the levels, we scheduled your benefits planning meeting, so I think we're in good shape right now.
Alright. Yeah. Is there anything else you need from us? Like, any additional resources that you may need help with?
Um, that you want me to look into? Not right now.
Mhm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:23:12}
Not right now, other than you… we discussed the gas cards, but I'm not really in the… the gas has come down, so I'm not really too concerned.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:23:20}
Okay, you don't need the gas cards? We could still provide them to you as long as you work 30 hours or more.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:23:27}
Yeah, that's… I mean…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:23:31}
We can use them. Yeah, okay, I'll put in the… so once I get the pay stubs, and I review them, I can put in for two gas cards.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:23:40}
Well, it'll probably be one.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:23:42}
Oh, one, okay.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:23:43}
Nothing.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:23:44}
Oh, because of the hours. Yeah. Okay, no problem. Yep, so every time you submit a stub, I'll go ahead and put in a gas card, and you get up to 12, by the way, so that'll be one of 12. Mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:23:58}
Okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:23:59}
It's sent by my manager.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:24:00}
Oh, you're.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:24:01}
or.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:24:01}
Was that for the year, or…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:24:03}
Um, for the duration, and then… yeah, for the duration.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:24:08}
I shouldn't need them until after this month, then.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:24:12}
Okay. It's up to you. You get 12, so you get to choose. Well, that's something we could talk about each month. Do you need them this month? Do you not need them this month? Mm-hmm. I should need them every year.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:24:22}
After this month, James.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:24:23}
Okay, but you do, once you submit for these… this stub, you do want it for this stub.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:24:28}
Yeah. Okay, great. Let me make a note. Okay, I'm glad you asked about that.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:24:35}
Requested… Okay, gas card… Once… Pay stub is obtained, got it. Mm-hmm.
Alright. Alright, so we're all set.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:24:51}
Alright, well, thank you for your time, and…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:24:54}
Of course.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:24:55}
It's me there.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:24:56}
Thank you so much for reaching out. Yeah.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:24:59}
And I will reach back out to you, um, Probably next month.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:25:04}
Would you like to schedule our appointment? We can schedule it ahead of time, um, that way we have it on the calendar to talk.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:25:12}
It might be better to…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:25:15}
You want to call me? By ear.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:25:18}
Whichever way's easier for you, it's easier to play it by ear.
So, uh…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:25:21}
Okay.
Well, I'll be talking anyway, too.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:25:24}
on the 13th, so…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:25:26}
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:25:27}
Maybe that's that time, then.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:25:29}
Alright, that sounds great. I might do a mini check-in, um, just to be in compliance with the 30 days, because by the 30 days, it will have to be at least by February 2nd, but I'll just do a quick check-in with you. Yeah. I can check in the beginning.
Yeah, beginning of February, just to see. Yeah, that's perfect, that counts. Mm-hmm.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:25:55}
Welp.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:25:56}
Thank you very much.

[JOHN BARRY FARMER] {00:25:57}
Thank you very much, Ana, and you have a good.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:25:58}
You're welcome. You as well, John. You take care. Thank you so much for reaching out. Bye-bye.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:00}
Hi, can you hear me?

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:00:02}
Yeah, now I can. Um, you know what it looks like happened, is when I stopped being able to hear you.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:09}
I, uh…

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:00:10}
A signal dropped.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:12}
Hello? What bar?

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:00:13}
And it did come back up, but you didn't come back, so I just…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:17}
It's so weird, because I could hear you. You were breaking up a little, but I could hear you, but it was clear you couldn't hear me.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:00:23}
Yeah, I don't know why. It does that every once in a great while. I'm outside, even, because otherwise my dog and my cat like to help.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:33}
Yes, clearly.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:00:35}
I, um… it does that. Every once again, wow, I'll… it'll just… the signal will drop down.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:44}
Oh, wow.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:00:45}
Yeah, it's weird. I wonder if it's… I don't know if it has anything to do with… I'm seeing clouds coming in again?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:54}
Oh, that could be it.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:00:56}
Yeah, it could be.
I don't know if that's what's doing it or what, but something.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:07}
Um… So… I was just saying that we'll have another job lead session in Later in January, and I'll send out that link again.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:01:18}
Okay. Okay.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:20}
Alright, let's take a look here.
At my calendar, get another time on here.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:01:27}
Okay, the week of January 12th.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:31}
I did.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:01:32}
I do have jury duty, it's that one where you just call.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:37}
I…

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:01:37}
I don't know if I'm gonna end up, you know, going in.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:41}
How about Monday the 19th? We'll do the following week.
Um… Does this time slot work for you? Or the next… or 9 a.m? 9 or 10?

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:01:52}
Hm.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:54}
Alright, then I will give you a call then, and if you need anything before then, as always, just let me know.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:02:00}
Okay, thank you.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:02:02}
Alright, Happy New Year. It was good talking with you. Happy New Year.

[SHEILA MARIE OSMEK] {00:02:04}
Bye.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:02:06}
Bye.

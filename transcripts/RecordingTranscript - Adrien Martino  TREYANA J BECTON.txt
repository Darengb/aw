Uh, let me digit.
I'll take a look.
Um, it looks like she's offline at the moment.
So, that means she's very likely not in.

So, Yoda Odessa is, like, the one I'm working with that they assigned me to.

[Adrien Martino] {00:01:04}
Oh, okay.

[TREYANA J BECTON] {00:01:05}
Um, TREANA BECTO, by the way, she should recognize the name TRYNA BECTON.

Alright.

[TREYANA J BECTON] {00:01:12}
And.

[Adrien Martino] {00:01:15}

[TREYANA J BECTON] {00:01:24}
She was wondering how much was the state, uh.

[Adrien Martino] {00:01:28}
You know what?

[TREYANA J BECTON] {00:01:29}

[Adrien Martino] {00:01:33}
The idea? To… to buy it?

[TREYANA J BECTON] {00:01:35}
Yes.

[Adrien Martino] {00:01:37}
Okay.

[TREYANA J BECTON] {00:01:37}
And she wanted me… she wanted me to inform her of how much it was.
And… I've been trying to… Paul.
and email her, but I haven't got a response yet, and then I got, like, an email Talking about, I haven't… Hennessy, what are you doing, bro? I'm so sorry. Anyway.

[Adrien Martino] {00:02:01}

[TREYANA J BECTON] {00:02:01}

[Adrien Martino] {00:02:04}

[TREYANA J BECTON] {00:02:05}

Email her.

[TREYANA J BECTON] {00:02:11}

[TREYANA J BECTON] {00:02:22}
And I haven't got a.

[Adrien Martino] {00:02:23}
Come on. Just give me a moment.
Um, okay, so I will let you know.
Those emails or, like, texts, they are often sent in error.
Because I know people have called in the past, and it's be… and, like, most of the time, it was an error, it shouldn't have been sent.
Um, so that's, like, very possible in your case, but I can still reach out to her. Could you spell your first and last name for me?

[TREYANA J BECTON] {00:02:51}
E-R-E…

[Adrien Martino] {00:02:53}

Got it. And this is the best phone number to reach you?

[TREYANA J BECTON] {00:03:27}

[Adrien Martino] {00:03:28}
Alright.
No worries, I will go ahead and reach out to her, um… if I see that she pops online, I'll give her a call, but for now, I'm just gonna send an email.
Um… Just so that she can follow up with you, and at least make sure that that email was not relevant to you.
So you received… okay, so I'm just gonna let her know you received the email that… Stated, you are not compliant.
And… did you… um, you said you already sent her some emails about the ID?

[TREYANA J BECTON] {00:04:06}
Yeah, I did. I texted the number that she responded on, um…

[Adrien Martino] {00:04:12}
Okay. Uh, it's numbers.

[TREYANA J BECTON] {00:04:14}
718… Uh, 5… 5… 0?
2-0… 7… uh, no, no, 2-0.
8, 7, uh, that's the number that…

[Adrien Martino] {00:04:28}
protected, but…

[TREYANA J BECTON] {00:04:29}
I don't know if that's the right number or not.

[Adrien Martino] {00:04:32}
Okay, no worries. Um, no, that sounds okay.
And… could you just tell me how much that ID was, so I can, um, at least put it in the email, just in case?

[TREYANA J BECTON] {00:04:42}
$10 to $15.

[Adrien Martino] {00:04:44}
Okay. Alright, you got it. Alright, I'll go ahead and send this out to you. Um, like I said, it looks like she's offline, so probably won't get back to you today. Um, but… odd, you know… Monday.
Most people are coming back to the office.
Alright, sounds good. Anything else you need help with?

[TREYANA J BECTON] {00:05:07}
No, that's all for now. Thank you so much.

[Adrien Martino] {00:05:09}

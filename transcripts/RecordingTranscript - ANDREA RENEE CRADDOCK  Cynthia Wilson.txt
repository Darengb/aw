[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:00:01}
Hello, Andrea.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:02}
Hi, good morning, Andrea. Happy New Year. This is Cynthia Wilson with the Medical Works. How are you?

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:00:07}
Hey, good morning. Doing pretty fair, thank God.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:12}
Okay. How was your holidays?

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:00:15}
It's good, thank you, Lord.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:17}
I like that.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:00:18}
Mm-hmm, fast.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:19}
That's good, I'm glad, I'm glad.
Am I nice and quiet?

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:00:25}
Good.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:26}
Nice and quiet, thank God for that.
I'm just calling to remind you, um, to make sure that you send me the copies of your pay stubs for the month of December. I haven't received them as of yet.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:00:41}
Thank you for reminding me.
There's a lot going on in my head.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:45}
Yes, ma'am. And you're still tutoring?

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:00:51}
I am, I'm trying to find more work, though, so I'm…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:55}
Mm-hmm. Look in.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:00:56}
into redoing my resume right now.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:59}
Okay. Mm-hmm. What is it that you are interested in doing?
Like, one shot.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:01:06}
Either more, um, like, sub work, like I'm doing now.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:11}
Or, um…

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:01:15}
Uh, working in the medical office.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:19}
Like, a receptionist?

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:01:21}
Yeah, mhm.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:23}
Oh, no.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:01:24}
They don't call it receptionist, though, they call it, uh… It's called Medical Office… Administrative, or something like that.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:33}
administrative assistant. Yeah.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:01:35}
But it's… the word medical is in it also, so…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:40}
Okay. Well, I can look for some of those in your area, and I can call you and send you the information when I find them.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:01:49}
Okay.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:50}
Consider that.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:01:53}
So, I'm just going online right now, and, you know, not every day, but… as I have time to…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:00}
Trying to figure out…

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:02:00}
I had to redo my resume.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:03}
Okay. Well, I can also assist you with that as well, um, what is it that you want to do with your resume?

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:02:11}
do I need to add?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:14}
Tutoring?

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:02:16}
Wow, yeah.
Yeah.
If I… If I go into a tutoring position, I need to… Be able to put something, you know, tutoring or subbing, or a pair of… Paraprofessional, anything like that.
something more that, that, you know, I guess that… relates to that, that I've done in the medical field, which I don't know yet.
how to… transform them.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:49}
So you, right now, what are you doing? You're tutoring, or are you par… are you doing both? Tutoring and para-subbing?

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:02:58}
I'm not Power 7, no. No, I'm just tutoring.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:03:01}
Okay.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:03:02}
Tutoring kids that are on, um…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:03:05}
A lower level.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:03:07}
with fear… how do they say? They didn't test high enough, put it that way.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:03:12}
Okay, okay.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:03:14}
in the regular classrooms, they just didn't test high enough.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:03:17}
Mhm.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:03:19}
to move on.
You know, with the… with the class, how do you say?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:03:25}
Okay.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:03:27}
So they get extra help in school.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:03:30}
Yeah.
Okay.
So I can, um… and you started this in October, right?

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:03:41}
No, actually, I started in the summertime.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:03:45}
Oh, okay.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:03:50}
My date of start was, like, June 5.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:03:59}
So you would have to… when you send me your paystubs, send me your paystubs from… Um, your start date, send me from June. I have… Um, November's pay stubs. Okay.
Alright, now, send me from… It was only during the song… it was only…

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:04:17}
Um, no. Summer school don't last that long.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:20}
It was just doing.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:04:21}
Summer.
They don't…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:24}
They are cute, cute.
Okay.
They don't feel like they used?

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:04:30}
Sue.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:32}
Did you go back in August?

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:04:35}
Hmm, I did.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:37}
Okay, so… I don't think so September.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:04:38}
our database.
It might have been… that's, um… It was the first or second week in September. It wasn't quite August, so…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:50}
Okay.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:04:51}
started doing my in-services in August, but not working.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:55}
Okay.
Send me all of those, I'll work on your, um, resume, I'll call you, and, um, I won't get to it today, but I will, um, work on it, and then I'll call you, and we'll go over it, and… Okay, again.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:05:18}
Thousand things to do still today.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:05:20}
My Christmas gift.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:05:22}
Christmas won't be over until my grandbaby get on that plane on Monday.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:05:27}
So… Oh!

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:05:28}
I'm still… Grandbaby, caregiver, doing…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:05:32}
compliment, so… Okay, so I can promise you.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:05:36}
I would try to get the, the, the, the, um, pay stubs to you today.
Bye.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:05:41}
Okay, how old is your grandbaby?

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:05:44}
This one, I only have one left here. The other ones were much, much younger. All the younger ones are gone.
This one is 10.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:05:52}
Oh, okay, okay. But all the babies…

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:05:54}
They just be gone.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:05:56}
Oh, okay. They went bank where they.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:05:58}
parents.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:05:59}
And I'm quite sure you missed them already.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:06:03}
I do, but I ain't used to having a bunch of babies around, so… I love it when I have it, and when I don't, praise the Lord.
They mamas and daddies do it.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:06:18}
Yeah. But it is interesting to watch.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:06:22}
Watch my children try to tell me how to…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:06:26}
How to take care of their children, parent their children.
Yeah, it's, it's, it's a whole new…

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:06:31}
A whole new ballgame. Muh. Uh-huh Don't let them go in the front, only the backyard.
I'm looking at them like… Yeah. But that was my plan anyway.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:06:44}
Because I don't trust.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:06:46}
the front. They might.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:06:48}
Like, running the same I'm looking like.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:06:51}
I think I told you that.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:06:54}
Okay.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:06:56}
I just love.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:06:57}
Like, wow.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:07:00}
Glad you know how to do it, though.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:05}
Yeah. Oh my goodness. Oh, yeah.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:07:08}
The… My child is teaching me how to parent now.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:12}
Isn't that funny? It is funny.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:07:16}
Amazing.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:18}
Yeah. Glad they good parents.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:07:20}
I'm glad they got.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:21}
Don't you?

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:07:22}
I'm glad I don't have to be a grandma to raise my grandchildren.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:25}
Amen, amen.
Even though I do kind of, um.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:07:29}
assist with the 10-year-old. Mm-hmm.
A lot, because him… Because his parents, like, co-parent.
But…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:37}
Okay.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:07:38}
My son, of course, I don't have any girls, but my son is the father to the 10-year-old.
He's not as patient in knowing how to be a parent.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:50}
Oh my goodness.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:07:52}
use learning.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:53}
patients.
Mm-hmm. You've learned.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:07:55}
Learning that this is the way to parent.
But we all pitch in to help them.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:02}
Right.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:08:02}
Yeah, about a picture.
His name is Adrienne.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:08}
That's what we call it. That's what we say.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:08:10}
in the family. His name is Adrian, and because his name is Adrian.
Uh, let's just go get Avery right now.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:17}
Uh-oh. Yeah, he doesn't touch his.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:08:20}
He don't be this child.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:22}
No, none of that.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:08:23}
But…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:25}
you…

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:08:25}
can raise his voice.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:26}
The sternness and… yes, the sternness is enough, especially coming from the Father. Yes! There's a total difference.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:08:39}
total difference.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:41}
I've never understood that, but it's a total difference coming from the father as opposed to the mother. I guess because we are more nurturers, and the fathers, you know, they're the head of the household, you know, their voices… Oh, it's just… it's like that… pitching that tone just gets in your… gets in your soul, and you, like, get that act right real quick. It sure does. We just had a meeting with my.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:09:13}
with my son, and I'm telling you about, because he.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:09:16}
Oh, my goodness.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:09:17}
He doesn't understand why his son don't come to him about everything. He come to me about everything.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:09:21}
Mm-hmm, because he's a friend to you.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:09:24}
And he was like, son, I don't want you to be afraid of me. I want you to come to me about everything. But we just had, like, a whole family meeting about this, and um… Avery… Avery is at the point now he's not afraid.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:09:37}
Mm-hmm.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:09:38}
But he's not… He's still timid about coming to him about something.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:09:42}
Mhm.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:09:44}
So he's like, he's like, are you afraid? He's like, no, Dad, it's just… I just don't… come to you, I don't know why, you know, he couldn't explain it in words. So, I kind of interjected for him. I said.
But this is the deal, Adrian, because my children never met my dad. My dad died when I was 10.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:10:06}
I think it's…

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:10:07}
I was really scared of my dad when I was young.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:10:10}
of age.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:10:11}
All my dad had to do was open his mouth.
And I was shaking like it was an earthquake. I said, kids are, uh, afraid of dance, and then everybody else kind of pitched in and said the same thing.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:10:23}
But it made my son recognize his childhood. And he said.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:10:28}
Yeah, you're right, because I was afraid of Daddy for a long time.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:10:30}
Mm-hmm. Excuse me.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:10:31}
And there you go.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:10:33}
Right?
That's good that y'all were able to assist him. Well, assist both of them, and try to bring it into the median that he was able to see, and hear from his son, and also from you all.
Um, what you all observe, and what you all have been through, and then he himself was able to, um.
Articulate, you know, go back to his childhood, and remember how… it made him feel when his dad did that to him. So, you know, hopefully with that and being an eye-opener, it will help him to, you know, not so much as change, because you want him to… Yeah, exactly. You need him to, you know.
be able to discipline and have that sternness, but, you know, just to be able to come at his child in a different way where his child is. In a different way, exactly. Not so much… I don't want to say in fear of him, or scared of him, but understand exactly that respect, and understand what his dad is trying to say to him to keep him out of harm's way, to keep him out of trouble, and to keep him on the straight and narrow. And that's, you know, what…
all it is. And, um… It's great that you guys are able to bridge that gap. And when… yeah. And his mama…

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:12:06}
His mama… that's her world. That's her only child.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:12:10}
That's the world.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:12:12}
And so she shares life with him, if you understand what I'm saying. Yes.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:12:18}
And I think some of the life that she shares with him may be a little bit too much for his…

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:12:24}
Mine.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:12:25}
Mhm. Who…

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:12:26}
Um, absorbed, and then he got his dad on the other end.
Telling him that these things, that he… that he sees his mom Is okay with is not necessarily.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:12:40}
Okay.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:12:41}
Right. So, I have to be, like, the median, that's why I said I'm the…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:12:47}
In between, of the two of them.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:12:49}
Right now.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:12:49}
Mm-hmm.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:12:50}
Because right now, we're trying to, um… To help Avery He's gonna move here.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:12:58}
He has to understand two… he has to understand both worlds.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:13:03}
Right, both worlds.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:13:04}
And right now.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:13:05}
We're trying to get him to be able to… How do you explain it? Um, he's gotta do a bridge over… Because he's moving here for the school… next school.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:13:18}
When you go to school.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:13:19}
year after that.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:13:21}
Mhm. So…

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:13:21}
We're preparing him mentally right now.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:13:25}
Wednesday's Day, it was.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:13:25}
like, do you not want to move here? Because he was, like, seeing it. It was a hesitancy.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:13:31}
And I say.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:13:32}
Well… to speak for… for the child, Adrian.
this is change. Adults don't do change very well.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:13:42}
So…

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:13:43}
You got to understand, this is a child that has to deal with something.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:13:47}
new.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:13:47}
Not knowing what he's coming into. He enjoys Florida to come visit.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:13:52}
Right. But when it comes to live here… That's something different. And you also don't want him to feel like he's being punished.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:14:01}
Right, right, all of that.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:14:04}
But the… but they.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:14:05}
We have already… this is something that has been in the making for years.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:14:09}
now.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:14:11}
for years.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:14:12}
He's been…

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:14:13}
I've been talked to about this for years.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:14:16}
That, um…

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:14:19}
at some point.
You… Do you… because they've asked him, do you want to come stay with Dad? He's like, yes.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:14:25}
He likes.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:14:27}
The idea, but he doesn't understand what it all entails.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:14:30}
Right.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:14:32}
that.
Um, but we had to talk to them a little bit more extensive this time and say, look.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:14:37}
Mm-hmm. Was weird.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:14:38}
where your fears are, because he has already developed a group of friends where he lives. He's on the student council at his school. This is 5th grade, and he's getting ready to graduate, and he wants to trans… Um, transitioning into middle school with his friends.
Which makes sense.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:14:57}
However, but if you.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:14:58}
If it's too late, it may never happen.
So that's the… 6th or 7th grade thing that we're working with right now.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:15:09}
Okay.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:15:10}
which grade would probably be better for him. I'm starting to think 7th grade would be better for him.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:15:16}
Mhm.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:15:17}
What grade is he in now?
In the 5th, getting ready to graduate from…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:15:22}
Mhm.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:15:23}
is.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:15:24}
from elementary.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:15:24}
They… 5th graders have a real graduation now.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:15:28}
Oh, okay.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:15:29}
Yeah.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:15:30}
So then, is he gonna skip the 6th grade and go straight to the 7th?

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:15:37}
No, no, no, they graduate because they go to… they're going into middle school.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:15:42}
Oh, okay.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:15:44}
And that's why they do graduations now.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:15:47}
Okay.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:15:48}
Is it going from one… You know, what you call it?
Type of school to another.
You know, level of schooling.
So, they… I'm surprised that they don't do it in New York. They do it everywhere.
Graduate.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:16:04}
I agree, um… They don't… they no longer call it a graduation.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:16:10}
Oh. They call it a moving up ceremony.
Oh.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:16:15}
Because the graduation is when you graduate high school.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:16:19}
Oh, okay.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:16:20}
Yeah.
Some may call it a moving-up ceremony. We still consider it a graduation as parents, but the schools now, um, they just call it a moving up ceremony.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:16:31}
Oh, okay.
So, you know, after he does that, he wants to go over to… The middle school with his friends.
Which makes sense.
However, if he waits too late, it… he… I don't know.
if he'll… even move here. He wants to move here, he really does. He says, he is… Because it's all his decision.
Nice.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:16:57}
Right.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:16:58}
Nobody forcing him.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:17:00}
understands.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:17:01}
The need to be with his dad.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:17:04}
Mom.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:17:04}
Understands the need to be with his dad.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:17:08}
But.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:17:08}
talking.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:17:09}
to him.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:17:10}
we've allowed him to make the decision. His dad even told him the other day, if you don't want to move here, you don't have to.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:17:18}
Right.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:17:19}
So, it… all about… what he wants to do, but at the same time, like I told my son.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:17:27}
Mm-hmm.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:17:27}
That could be a scary move.
It is, knowing the type of father that he has. Yes. You know, um… Yes.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:17:35}
he… he wants to do it, but, you know, he's like, am I gonna be getting in trouble all the time? Yeah. Is he gonna be yelling at me all the time? Right, all that.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:17:46}
Mm-hmm.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:17:46}
And that plays with the child's mental. It does. It does.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:17:51}
And that's how Adrian started off parenting, but now he doesn't parent that way.
As much, you know.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:18:00}
The reason for it is, because.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:18:02}
You know, because, see, that's who he is, but he don't raise it just to be raising it like he used to.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:18:07}
Mhm.
Right.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:18:09}
He… he does something he… he recognized he had to work on within himself, and he was…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:18:15}
That's a sign.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:18:16}
You know, if I say something to you the way you don't like it, or I've come off… So he's very honest with his son.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:18:24}
But he steals.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:18:25}
You know, gotta work.
himself. Right. And in the meantime, my grandson gotta work on… Being able to come to his dad comfortably.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:18:37}
Because my grandm.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:18:37}
My grandson is actually doing some things he hasn't done.
Throughout… because he comes here every summer and every winter.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:18:45}
Torah.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:18:46}
And, um… He's done something that he hasn't done in the past.
We gave him a decision for, um, New Year's Eve.
Who do you want to be with?
Nana or your dad?
And he said.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:19:04}
He's…

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:19:04}
Yeah. He's never done that.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:19:07}
That's beautiful.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:19:09}
it to be under me, because he's a mama's boy.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:19:11}
Uh-huh.
But he's growing up.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:19:15}
Yeah, he's growing up, and he told me, he said, I want to be with it. I was like, okay, there's nothing wrong with that, because he… at first he thought, you know, maybe I'm hurt now.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:19:25}
Whatever you want.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:19:27}
want to do.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:19:28}
Right, because that's your father. Yes, and this is about… Right. Your relationship. It's your relationship with your dad.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:19:36}
Exactly, exactly.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:19:38}
Now, I did.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:19:39}
I do leave the door open for my son, I say it now.
If he comes here, because my son works, and he's concerned about his work schedule, and… I'm spending time with Avery.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:19:53}
Uh-huh. I said, well.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:19:53}
what you can do, if you want to, you know, I just gave him the door to open that door for him.
I said, he can stay with me on the weekdays and go to school from here, and stay with you on the weekends.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:20:06}
I'm gonna do it that way.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:20:08}
So, my son didn't answer me yet, because we still don't know when he's coming.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:20:12}
Right.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:20:13}
I say that's an option, so you don't have to wonder, what am I gonna do? Because his girlfriend's family is not as, um… receptive, shall I say?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:20:25}
Okay.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:20:26}
Um… She has a 10-year-old also.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:20:32}
Avery.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:20:33}
But her 10-year-old is very, very spoiled. My grandson is not spoiled. He's very… his mom is raising him very good, because.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:20:43}
This is very…

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:20:44}
with what… I'm telling you, you can give this boy a penny for Christmas.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:20:48}
So does she feel that by him coming… by him bringing his son… No, she's.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:20:54}
okay with it.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:20:56}
No, not the mother. I'm talking about, uh, AJ as well. The girlfriend. She's okay with it. Oh, she's okay with it. She's okay with it. Avery's mom.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:21:06}
Family.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:21:08}
of her family.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:21:09}
That whispers in her ear.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:21:12}
Family has nothing to do with it.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:21:14}
Well, she, that's another thing, they trying to work on.
Her not listening to her family about everything.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:21:22}
Mm-hmm. Because she…

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:21:24}
cheese.
she wants Avery to… I mean, Avery, Adrian, my son. She wants Adrienne to marry her.
Adrian Blankton.
I ain't marrying her with that family in my head.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:21:37}
Mm-hmm.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:21:38}
No. And she don't see that, and so when I try to… because she listens to me, but so I try to tell her things… You know, with a long hample spoon.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:21:51}
Is she very supportive Our son is full.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:21:54}
And she's spoiled. And it's because our parents got both of them spoiled.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:22:00}
And…

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:22:02}
Oh, boy.
They finally went to church on New Year's Eve, thank God.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:22:07}
Oh, that's good!

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:22:09}
Thank God, that's a… that's a big breaker right there.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:22:13}
Uh-huh. Cause they both, both.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:22:16}
come from church, families, backgrounds.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:22:18}
Mm-hmm.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:22:19}
And… they met in the club. It wasn't in the club, it was real close to it.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:22:25}
Mm-hmm. And here we got two children.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:22:28}
Start to go raid.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:22:29}
in the church, meeting in the club. It happens sometimes. It does, it does. It happens sometimes, yes. And with the girl in my church.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:22:39}
right now. She… she left the church, grew up in.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:22:42}
It just ain't my son.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:22:43}
Let's.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:22:44}
We had a husband.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:22:44}
in the clue. Emily got married, she came back to church.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:22:48}
Right. So, yeah, they… and they still merit to this day. It happens like that sometimes.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:22:55}
Which, you know, I ain't complaining, because the guy got, you know, a way of doing things to put people together, but if… I would like them to, in 2026, God help them.
Cause sometimes I be like, ooh, uh-uh.
Lord, just… just draw them closer to you. That's all I can do is pray for them. Because they… they love each other.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:23:18}
Like, I'm situated.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:23:19}
and circumstances like this one's spoil This and this one, da-da-da.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:23:24}
Right. And I wanted my.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:23:25}
away in it.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:23:27}
Yeah. That's how it can be.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:23:30}
Y'all need that over there. I can't deal with that.
And, um, my, um… so, yeah, this is why I told my son It might be better to let him come stay here with Nana.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:23:43}
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:23:46}
I'll do the weekend thing.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:23:47}
an account. Right.
Yeah, because your son is off on the weekends.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:23:52}
Yeah.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:23:53}
Yeah, that would be better, because you don't want him to be being mistreated or anything like that.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:23:58}
And my grandmother.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:23:59}
Brilliant.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:24:00}
And I don't think she will mistreat him.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:24:03}
Her parents are…

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:24:05}
Very… like, standoffish when my grandson around.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:24:12}
And her parents…

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:24:13}
This helps her keep the other two boys.
are their grandkids.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:24:21}
But this one is not…

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:24:23}
Her grandcha… grandchild.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:24:26}
So I'm like, mm-mm.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:24:28}
I'm his grandm.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:24:28}
You're doing right. You're doing right. You gotta protect the welfare of your child. You don't want anybody mistreating your grandchild. Yeah, even if it's.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:24:38}
and don't.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:24:38}
And bringing more trauma to him. Yeah, more trauma to him.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:24:43}
went through a lot. He just.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:24:45}
He lost his.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:24:45}
Caregiver grandma.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:24:48}
Eh, 2 months.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:24:48}
months ago.
The woman dropped dead because of sepsis, went to the hospital, ended up septic. Younger than me.
And that's who took care of him.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:25:01}
Mm-mm.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:25:02}
because of his mama's schedule. The grandmama was the one.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:25:07}
work from home.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:25:08}
Grandma worked from home. When he come home from school, grandma was there to give him his night, set him up for.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:25:13}
somewhere, give you.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:25:14}
His dinner, his bedtime, whatever.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:25:17}
She was there.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:25:18}
That whole thing is gone now.
So, I'm like…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:25:25}
Don't worry about it, y'.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:25:26}
I ain't gotta worry about mistreating him, that's why I'm like, I got whatever job I got, I gotta make sure it's centered around him.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:25:34}
And that's what the grandma.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:25:36}
did, the one that he lived with, she made sure everything was centered around him.
Because of.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:25:42}
Yeah, he does.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:25:43}
Went through a lot.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:25:46}
That's a lot. That's a lot. I thank you for sharing with me, so at least it lets me know, you know, when I'm looking for this position for you, you know, to make sure that it is… gonna be, um, accommodating to what you need. Yeah. And again, I don't know exactly what.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:26:04}
And he's normally…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:26:05}
not moved.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:26:06}
Till seventh grade, which is a whole new.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:26:08}
Right.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:26:09}
have. But at the same time, if I'm already.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:26:11}
setups.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:26:12}
somewhere.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:26:13}
Right. Where I know why.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:26:14}
I'm comfortable enough to say, okay.
I can have, because that probably will work better for me anyways.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:26:23}
I'm talking to you.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:26:24}
I can have some resolve.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:26:27}
Right. If I need them all.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:26:28}
You know, or something like that. But anyway, yeah, that's basically…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:26:32}
What I'm trying to work on.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:26:35}
Indeed.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:26:35}
And if I.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:26:36}
I work Monday through Friday at a doctor's office. Really, that probably won't…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:26:41}
Mm-hmm. Except for in the.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:26:42}
time, yeah, in the summertime. But then, even at that.
He can go to his dad's a lot in the summertime.

Okay.

[ANDREA RENEE CRADDOCK] {00:26:50}

Hello?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:02}
Hi, may I please speak with Eugene Costine III?

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:00:06}
Trust me.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:07}
Hi, Eugene, it's Cynthia Wilson with America Works, how are you?

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:00:11}
I am hanging in there, how are you?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:13}
I am doing well. Happy New Year.
Thank you. I'm just checking in to see how things are going, to see, um, if you found employment, if you're still working, or you're no longer working, what's going on?

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:00:31}
Found employment, lost a job, found employment, lost a job. I've been in and out of the hospital.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:39}
It's been kind of hard to keep.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:00:40}
Regular.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:42}
I'm so sorry to hear that.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:00:45}
I have now… I found another job.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:49}
Mhm.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:00:49}
And then, so I actually got 2 jobs, and the first one, uh… the, uh, the one job It was like a 45-minute drive from my house.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:01}
Mm-hmm.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:01:02}
So then, um, I found this other job, which is 15 minutes.
And pays considerably more, so I'm like, I'm not gonna have to drive, you know, an hour and a.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:13}
a half, you know, around.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:01:14}
trip, and… and I have a truck, and it's got a V8, so it sucks gas.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:20}
Right.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:01:21}
You know, and plus it pays more, so the only logical thing was, I felt, instead of just waiting to the last second to tell them, oh, by the way, I quit.
you know, I thought that would be disingenuous of me.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:38}
So, I went ahead and.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:01:39}
When am I accepted in another position, and they… what?
I'm on the phone.
Excuse me?
Yes? Uh-huh.
departure perspective.
Okay.
Pulled up, all that trash out.
Okay, I'm on a business call, so I'll have to discuss this with you later.
Thank you.
And, yeah, so I just thought that was being wrong, and…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:10}
Mhm.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:02:11}
So, I… and so… and they were hiring me for a position that was… It's needed that, you know… I wanted to give them time to find someone else.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:23}

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:02:23}
So I felt I had to tell them, like, I accepted the job.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:27}
position.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:02:29}

Anything that is going to make you sick.

It's… mine is my… I've, I've had… In the past 2 years, I've had 5 or 6 surgeries on my.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:02}
Uh, right foot.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:04:03}
trying to keep it, because I'm an amputee on the left leg.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:07}
Right.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:04:07}
trying to keep that right leg, because if I lose my right leg, then I can't drive, and…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:12}
Mhm.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:04:13}
You know, and then, you know, there's… so, that's what I'm… that's what I'm trying to do, is save that right leg.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:21}

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:04:24}
And… so… and I've messed up my back. I had a bad fall.
about September.
So, um…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:34}
I'm sorry to hear that.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:04:36}
I went… went to see, uh… I went and had an MRI, and my back is pretty messed up.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:43}

Oh my goodness.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:04:53}
I have 2 doctors.
And for this… for the medical group.
And so… When I got the appointment, he couldn't see me until December.
And now he's… he's gonna do a treatment, but he can't do that until the end of February.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:05:11}
Oh, boy.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:05:13}
And he's just going… he's trying to go… um, conservative.
Because I told them, like, no surgeries. I can't afford… I'm starting a new job. So… But I was like, I need some kind of relief so I'm not in chronic pain 24-7.
And he, uh, you know, he wants to do this steroid injection.
Which, I've used my new best friend, ChatGPT, because he's helped me with my resume, and…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:05:42}
I say here.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:05:42}
You know, it, but…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:05:45}

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:05:51}
Earth.
You know, got the TV, I mean, it helped me, you know, because I am a… Convicted felon that's now 18 years old.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:06:03}
Mhm. And…

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:06:04}
Of course, that comes up.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:06:07}
Of course, but it doesn't mean that… it doesn't mean that… You made a mistake.
And you've paid your debt, and you're still human, we all make mistakes, and you deserve another chance to prove yourself, and to get it right.
That's the past, 8 years ago. Yes, it comes up, but, you know, you can get a certificate of disposition from the arresting court, and then you could just give them the certificate of disposition.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:06:41}
Yep, well, I mean, I've got my rights restored.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:06:44}
I got very good.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:06:45}

Um… And then my other son, um, he came, um, like, 6 months later.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:36}
Okay. You were staying with.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:07:37}
His mom, but he decided you know, he needed to be with me. Plus, she ended up passing away in 2023.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:46}
Oh, my condolences. I'm sorry to hear that.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:07:49}
I am. Most… I mean, mostly for them, and obviously.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:52}
officially…

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:07:53}
sorry for her, because, I mean, she is the mother of my children.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:56}
And to lose your mom when you're, you know, so, so young. Yes. Yeah.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:08:03}
Um, they weren't really close with her.
Right.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:08}
It still doesn't matter, it's their mom.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:08:11}
Right, exactly.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:13}
Yeah.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:08:14}
It doesn't matter my… Personal feelings towards her, you know?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:19}
Right.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:08:20}
I don't ever… I don't… I don't ever tell them anything. I never say anything bad in front of them about their money.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:24}
Right.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:08:26}
That, to me, would be wrong.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:28}
Exactly.
Yeah.
Okay, well, congratulations on… Wesley, come here. …on your new job. Yep. Congratulations.

[Eugene D Costine III] {00:08:43}

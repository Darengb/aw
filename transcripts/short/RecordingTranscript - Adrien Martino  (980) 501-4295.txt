Good afternoon, this is Adrienne with America Works. How can I help you?

[(980) 501-4295] {00:00:07}
Yes, I received a missed phone call.

[Adrien Martino] {00:00:10}
Yes, that, that was me. Um, I was calling about the Ticket to Work program.
Under Social Security.
Have you heard of that before? Um, it is helping SSI and SSDI recipients to find employment.

[(980) 501-4295] {00:00:30}
Okay.

[Adrien Martino] {00:00:30}
Are you looking for work?

[(980) 501-4295] {00:00:32}
Can you email me some information?

[Adrien Martino] {00:00:35}
Absolutely, mm-hmm. So, this program essentially entitles you to, um, choose a provider to help you find employment, receive free trainings, as well as Um, to receive benefits counseling, so you understand how employment could impact your benefits.
Are you on SSI or SSDI?

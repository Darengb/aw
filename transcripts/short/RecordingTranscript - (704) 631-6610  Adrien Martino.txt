Hello?

[Adrien Martino] {00:00:01}
Hi, good morning.
This is Adrienne with America Works. I'm calling for Luke McMillan. Yes, he is. Alright, I'm calling about the Ticket to Work program.
Have you heard of that before?

[(704) 631-6610] {00:00:14}
Yes, I have, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to work no more.

[Adrien Martino] {00:00:16}
Okay, understood. No worries. Have a good rest of your day.

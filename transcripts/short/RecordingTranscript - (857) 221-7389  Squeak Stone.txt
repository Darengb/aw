Hello?

[Squeak Stone] {00:00:02}
Hi, this is Squeak Stone calling from America Works and the Ticket to Work program. Am I speaking with Sheila?

[(857) 221-7389] {00:00:09}
Nope.

[Squeak Stone] {00:00:10}
Um, are you familiar with the Ticket to Work program?

[(857) 221-7389] {00:00:14}
Yeah, I'm all set. I don't… I can't talk right now, because I'm actually getting ready to head out to a wake.

[Squeak Stone] {00:00:18}
Oh, gosh, I'm really sorry. Um, is there a better time for me to call you back?

[(857) 221-7389] {00:00:24}
Um, yeah, tomorrow, uh, maybe Monday. Monday, anytime you want. Monday. Okay, that sounds great. I'll give you a call then.
Alright, thank you.

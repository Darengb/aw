Hi, good morning. This is Adrienne with America Works. I'm calling for Donald Thompson Jr.

This is Donald.

[Adrien Martino] {00:00:12}
Okay, I'm calling about the Ticket to Work program.
Under Social Security.
Have you heard of that before?

[(704) 309-3462] {00:00:19}
No, I'm disabled now.

[Adrien Martino] {00:00:22}
Okay, not looking for work. That's totally fine, no worries. Have a good rest of your day. Isaac.
Thank you. Bye-bye.

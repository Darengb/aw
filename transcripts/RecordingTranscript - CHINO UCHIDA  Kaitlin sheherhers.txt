[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:00:02}
Hi, Kaitlin.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:04}
Hi, how are you doing? Happy New Year!

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:00:07}
Happy New Year!

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:09}
Thank you! How… How was your holiday?

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:00:15}
It was quiet.
I was tired from the air and cleaning, so I took it easy.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:25}
Nice!

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:00:26}
Yeah, it was quiet in New Year. How about you?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:30}
It was good. I was just here, um… You know, I worked New Year's Eve, and left a little bit early, and then, um… Spent time with my daughter, and… I made some… I had gotten a pasta maker for Christmas, so I… so we made pasta for the first time, so that was kind of fun.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:00:52}
Oh, yeah. And, yeah, we just watched movies and hung out.
Oh, nice!

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:58}
Oh my goodness.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:00:58}
freshman year.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:00}
Yeah, it was.
Um, yeah, how's… how's everything else going?

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:01:07}
Okay, I'm just… Let alone energy still recovering.
Yeah, but uh… Oh, my name.
Um… I'm looking at my notes.
So, webinars, I ended up attending Two of them on New Year's Eve.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:32}
Oh, nice! How are they?

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:01:34}
So good. Um, I like the gauging Wages, um, one.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:41}
Oh, nice! I wondered about that one.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:01:44}
If you gave me a good opportunity to think about, like, a realistic cost of living?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:52}
Mhm.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:01:53}
Sure.
I know, like, a lot.
Bare minimum to ask?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:02:00}
Mhm.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:02:01}
So, that was good, because I haven't really thought about it, and… Yeah, so…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:02:08}
Yeah, and it can be tough, too, with inflation and everything. What maybe initially, when you stopped working versus now, could be definitely different.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:02:17}
Alright, and then, like… I also thought about how much I want to save for the future, like, for the retirement and all, so it was more than I imagined, you know?
Yeah, it does.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:02:32}
Yeah.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:02:33}
Renting the area is very expensive to…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:02:37}
It is.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:02:39}
So, it's like, you need at least $3,000 for the rent?
Keith, do you wanna…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:02:45}
Oh, wow.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:02:47}
area, so… yeah, it's a lot.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:02:51}
Mm-hmm. What's your rent now?

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:02:53}
Right now, I have a good deal, so that's why I never had to worry about it. Mm-hmm.
Because I got this apartment a while ago, and uh… it's rent control, so they don't… they… they only… they're only allowed to raise it.
Certain percentage of the year?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:03:14}
Mhm.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:03:15}
Okay, so… I've been prospected in that way, that's why I wasn't… I've been able to manage the disability benefits.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:03:28}
Speaking of the savvy benefits, usually at the year… in December, I get the letter from the Social Security saying this would be the new amount you will get for the new year.
Oh, mhm. But I think…

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:03:45}
The letter's been late. I see something arriving today.
I can see what's coming in the email from the…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:03:55}
Yep.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:03:57}
Um… And I think there's one letter coming from Social Security, so I think… I assume that's the letter, but usually I get it… I get it in December, so I was getting worried, but I guess… Because of the government shutdown and all.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:04:16}
Yeah.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:04:17}
behind, so… Yeah.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:04:20}
Makes sense.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:04:22}
So I'm not too worried, but for… for Zaka, Zaka.
Am I gonna get the benefits for New Year's? I got worried that that's, like, the only source of income.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:04:36}
Right. So, I mean, I do know, though, that the… the COLA increase, the cost of living increase, was 2%. So whatever you received in 2025, it should go up by 2%.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:04:50}
Okay, yeah, I remember that you sent me… sent us the email about how many percent, you know, increase you'll get, so that was the only… I appreciated that, so I was… that was the only information I had, so I trusted, you know, that's gonna really affect it on my account, too.
So, I wasn't too worried, but… yeah.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:05:16}
Yeah, but I can understand why, you know, when you… when you've always gotten it in December and it hasn't come, feeling a little nervous about that.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:05:24}
Yeah, yeah.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:05:26}
Okay, that's.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:05:26}
how I survive, and I really…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:05:29}
Mm, yeah.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:05:30}
To survive, so… But anyways, going back to the webinar, yeah, I saw the… Gauging wage revenue is helpful.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:05:44}
And also.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:05:45}
It gave us an actual phrase to use when negotiating authority.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:05:52}
Oh, yeah?

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:05:53}
Yeah, so it's like… What dimension?
Like, about my background.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:06:00}
Yep, being really specific. But it's important to remember never to negotiate until you've been made an offer.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:06:07}
I see, okay.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:06:08}
Because you don't have any leverage until that point.
Until you know that you're the candidate that they're… they want to hire, at that point, you know they probably don't want to lose you over a couple thousand dollars to take their second rate I see. Do you know what I mean? But I have lots of tips on, um, salary negotiation when you get to that point. I definitely, you know, have run workshops and stuff on that, and I'd be happy to help.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:06:37}
Yeah, I can count on that. I feel good about it.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:06:41}
Oh, good, good, good. And so, how are you feeling about 2026, and, like, thinking about your bigger goals?

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:06:49}
Um, I'm thinking of… Um… continue learning Python, and maybe, maybe… I'm hoping I could be forced… by string.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:07:05}
Mhm. I can…

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:07:05}
And I'll be ready to look… At the job… actual job posting, and think of, like, applying, and… You know…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:07:17}
Oh, that sounds great!

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:07:18}
Yeah, I think of, um… switching to… More interview-focused approach.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:07:27}
Mhm.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:07:28}
As I do that, I also, like, in a study-wise, I can… Start looking at the… Interview questions for the tech interviews?
And I can start practicing those questions, too, using the knowledge.
Like, the… what I learned?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:07:51}
Oh, God.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:07:51}
lines… So, like, the job search, actual job searching, like, applying and all.
goes parallel with the interview question practices, so that's what I envision, so… Yeah, I would like to start applying for jobs this year.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:08:12}
Oh, great! And I think that's a good, good way to… Line it up.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:08:17}
I don't… I'm a little nervous about the timelines, but… For sure, I want to start applying for jobs this year, so that's what I have in my mind.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:08:30}
That's great.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:08:30}
Yeah, related to that, the time management during a job searching webinar that I attended on Christmas Eve.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:08:40}
Yeah.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:08:41}
So touched up on that, that part, and… They talked about the micro habits, Like a Doolittle that?
Every day.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:08:53}
Mm-hmm. That's right.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:08:53}
the approach I use now, too, I kind of study a little bit every day, but also, um, they gave us an example of how to do that. You are in a job interview? So, like, for example.
That goes, like, sending one tailored application a day, or reaching out to one contact, or reviewing one job post, and learn keywords.
like, I can sort of use that example for my SMART goals for the future when I start applying for jobs, so I thought that was helpful, too, so I can, you know… Yeah, tweak the SMART goals.
In that sense, so that would be nice, too. So those webinars are really helpful.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:09:50}
Oh, I'm so glad that they were helpful. I know sometimes they're not exact… you know, sometimes they're a little… not exactly what you think they'll be, but I'm glad that the last two were very helpful.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:10:01}
Mm-hmm, yeah. And also the third webinar about work history, I attended this one before, but it was a good recap from the previous.
Uh, webinars I attended, and… And then that was facilitated by my favorite.
instructors, so I enjoy that, too. I enjoy learning from them.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:10:27}
Great.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:10:28}
Yeah.
So that was about nerdsin.
studying part. I study working on a new, new… Uh, class.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:10:40}
Mm-hmm.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:10:41}
19.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:10:41}
Oh, which one?

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:10:43}
Uh, it's called Data Cleaning in Python Essential Training.
And this one used the, uh… a feature called Codespace on GitHub, and I've never used it, so it took me a while to figure out how to start on that, but… So I spend the majority of… first week, trying to figure it out, and then the second week, I finished.
first couple chapters, so that was my goal for this period, so I had… I was able to achieve that goal, so… That was good, and steadiness.
going nicely. I have, like, 5… 5-6 more classes I want to.
take from LinkedIn Learning, so… Hopefully I can… I can pinch them quickly.
So, let's see… so that's, like, the immediate goal.
You know?
Time to, to take those classes.
Was that the study…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:11:56}
Excellent.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:11:57}
Also, the third goal of Nightmare… yeah, Nightmare Podcast. I did listen to that.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:12:03}
Oh yeah, how was that?

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:12:05}
Yeah, that's helpful. Um, I've been listening to a lot of podcasts about sleep and dreams.
And so this one was, like, a summary of all the information that I learned from other webinars, so I was… helpful, and… And… He explained my habitual nightmares, and why I have that, and… Excuse me.
And basically, my brain to rehearsing the… Exercise emotional significance, I guess?
Spanish So, like, the… The traumatic events.
Cause the significance of… Emotional experience, and… I guess… The brain remembers that and trying to recreate the… Similar episodes, not the exact same stories, but similar episodes, and then… Trying to process, like, it's sort of like looking for a resolution, but the… Because this is a disturbing dream for me, like.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:13:27}
Mhm.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:13:28}
Before we get, like, I get to the end of the story that my brain's looking for.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:13:36}
I wake up.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:13:37}
I wake up, it's too disturbing, and so then… The processing is incomplete, you know.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:13:46}
Right.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:13:47}
It sounds like you're doing a lot of reflection on that.
Yeah, so I think my brain is… I was trying to recreate a similar episode over and over, driving my sleep to find the resolution it needs.
Yeah. I think that's why I have this habit of nightmare, then… They did talk about the… techniques to… to help with that, and I…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:14:18}
Oh, yeah? What did they… what did they recommend?

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:14:22}
Um, it's called, uh, Emergency Rehearsal Therapy, so…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:14:28}
Mhm, sure.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:14:30}
And documenting… Nightmares, and then come up with the… Alternative ending, so it's like, if it was a sad dream… You use anything you can, like, you can use magical powers, or miracles, or whatever.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:14:48}
Mm-hmm.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:14:49}
Transmitting to a good ending.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:14:52}
Oh, that's great.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:14:54}
Yeah, and then you rehearse that good ending over and over.
And then, until that dream is resolved.
So, I do that already, that's why… It takes me a long time to… get up, because I'm doing the… doing the processing. Mm-hmm.
Yeah, so… But it… the podcast talks about it, too, so it was a good learning opportunity, too.
To learn what?
sleep is about, and what dream means, and stuff like that. So it was very interesting.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:15:37}
Yeah, it sounds it.
It sounds like you took away some good concrete.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:15:43}
Mhm.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:15:44}
Um… steps, or things.
That may help.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:15:49}
primary.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:15:50}
Maybe to reframe it.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:15:52}
Mm-hmm, silent, I enjoy learning that.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:15:56}
Fantastic.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:15:59}
So, for the small goals for next 2 weeks.
I want to continue attending two webinars.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:16:07}
Okay.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:16:08}
Speaking of that… And looking at the schedule you sent me… I had a… a few… a couple of ones that I was interested, but… I think I'll choose the communication skills for the first months of work.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:16:29}
Oh, that's a… that's a good one.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:16:32}
I like…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:16:33}
Especially where I know you have, you know, since English is your… isn't your first language, I know that you've found some of those things helpful in the past regarding communication.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:16:44}
Yeah, so I… I'm… I would like to attend that. I was also curious about the workforce, navigating workforce nowadays, but I look at my notes and I took it before.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:16:57}
Oh.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:16:58}
Yeah, so I think I'll just… I was in between two of those, but… Because I took the other one, I'll go with the communication skills for the first month of work.
Thank God.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:17:13}
Great.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:17:13}
Yeah, good one.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:17:15}
Yeah, I do too. I just sent that one. I just signed you up.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:17:18}
Let's see.
Let me check mine… oh yes, I got that email, thank you.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:17:22}
Oh, goodness.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:17:23}
Yeah.
And I think it's because of the holidays. I request the slides from the webinars, but they haven't arrived yet, so…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:17:36}
Oh.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:17:37}
arrive next week, but some of them were from, like, mid-December, and I'm forgetting the materials, so I was like, oh, I want to redo them before I forget, you know?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:17:50}
Well, I think that reaching back out is okay. Did you email them?
I did, I emailed them a couple times, but I think they might be still processing the addendums, too.
So, you know, maybe, maybe email them next week.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:18:07}
Okay, yeah, I can do that. I'll wait till next week, and if I didn't hear from them, I'll reach out to them again. It'll be, like, the third time reaching out to them, so… Yeah. Okay. Yeah, and CC me on it.
Oh, okay, I can…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:18:25}
Absolutely, so I… so if you don't hear back, I can follow up on this end.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:18:30}
Okay, yeah, that sounds good. I'll remember to do that. Thank you.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:18:35}
Yeah, of course.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:18:36}
So, the webinar is taken care of. The second goal is I want to continue working on, uh, the… Nink… minking… the data collection.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:18:48}
So, yep.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:18:49}
Cleaning one.
Uh, complete next two chapters. I might be able to finish this course, but I don't… I wanna… I don't wanna be too ambitious, um, how do you say, ambitious?
So, just two chapters as a goal, but if I could, I'll… I'll try to do more.
God, and then the third one… I want to see a friend who always comes and picks up on me. She's having a hard time.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:19:24}
Aww.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:19:25}
Yeah, so I wanna see her, and be supportive, like, listen to her.
You know? Cause she… She always comes and delivers the food and leaves set up the.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:19:38}
Aww.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:19:39}
My door and stuff, and she really helps me, so… I wanna… I don't… you know, typically I can't do a lot for her, but I can at least listen to her and be supportive, you know?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:19:53}
Absolutely.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:19:55}
Yeah, so I, I think… I should be done a favor.
The time zone is to see if I can get together with her.
Yeah.
Shop.
I'll do that. That's my third goal.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:20:12}
That's a… that's a great goal.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:20:13}
Yeah.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:20:14}
I'm sure she'll really appreciate it.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:20:18}
I, I hope I can help her, too.
So, this is what I have.
Today…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:20:26}
Mhm.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:20:27}
Yes.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:20:28}
Great. Well, those sound like good goals, a good, good start to 2026.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:20:33}
That's good, so I'm glad, I'm glad to hear that, and yeah.
Hmm.
It's gonna be a good year.
Yeah, I like making progress, it's beautiful.
Yeah.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:20:46}
Oh, well, I'm… of course, I'm happy to… I'm happy to help.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:20:52}
Yeah, thank you so much.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:20:54}
Of course, of course.
Um, is there anything else I can help you with today?

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:21:00}
I think this is it for now. You helped me with the webinar slides and stuff, so I know what to do. I think I'm good.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:21:12}
Excellent.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:21:14}
Next meeting is in two weeks.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:21:18}
Sounds good to me!

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:21:19}
Yep, and always, if you need anything in between, don't hesitate to reach out.
I will do that, I'll remember that. Thank you.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:21:28}
You're welcome. Alright, well, Happy New Year, and we will talk in a few weeks… in a couple weeks.

[CHINO UCHIDA] {00:21:34}
Happy New Year to you, too.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:21:36}
Thank you.
Bye now.
Bye-bye.

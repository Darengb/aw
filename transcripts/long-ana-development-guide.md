## What You're Doing Well

Ana, you bring tremendous value to the America Works team. Your technical knowledge, professionalism, and client care are evident in every call. Here's what stands out:

### 1. Exceptional Program Knowledge

You have mastered the complex details of Social Security benefits, trial work periods, and thresholds. Clients trust you because you know your stuff.

> "The threshold, um, for 2026 is 1,210... for 2026, it has gone up to $16.90. If you make more than that after the trial work period... you will, if you earn under that amount, you still get your pay."

You explain complicated rules in a way clients can understand, and you're patient when they ask the same question multiple ways.

### 2. Proactive Resource Offering

You don't wait to be asked—you offer help before clients know they need it.

> "Wait, before you go, Mr. Armore. One second, hello? I want to provide you with a resource before you hang up... I don't know if you've ever looked at your state jobs bank?"

Even when a client didn't qualify for the program, you made sure he didn't leave empty-handed. That's going above and beyond.

### 3. Thorough Benefits Explanation

You take the time to walk clients through every aspect of the program:

> "Great question. Yep, we can help you before getting employed if you can show proof that you have an interview scheduled. We can help you by sending you a gas card to get to the job interview. That's one. Number 2, you get up to 12 Visa gas cards..."

Clients leave your calls fully informed about what's available to them.

### 4. Professional Communication

Your greeting sets a professional tone:

> "Good morning, this is Anna Arvelo from America Works with the Ticket to Work program speaking. How can I help you?"

You're consistent, clear, and clients know exactly who they're speaking with.

### 5. Encouraging Client Questions

You make clients feel safe asking questions:

> "No, these are all very excellent questions, and I encourage you to keep asking."

This builds trust and ensures clients get the information they need.

### 6. Handling Difficult Conversations with Grace

When clients don't qualify or want something the program can't provide, you handle it professionally:

> "The only thing is that with our program, you have to be looking for full-time... But if that doesn't align with you, what I can do is refer you to your local state vocational rehabilitation, because they can help you find a part-time."

> "That's okay, it happens sometimes. You're welcome. You know, we just do what's best for you, the client, right?"

### 7. Emphasizing the Partnership

You establish that this is a two-way relationship:

> "I'm glad that you mentioned that communication piece, because that's actually one of the most important things of the program, is honest, two-way communication, right? Like, if I know what's going on, the more I can help you."

### 8. Bilingual Service

You serve Spanish-speaking clients in their native language, expanding access to the program—a valuable skill.

## Building Toward Your Goals

The following sections show you how to develop each of the capabilities outlined in your development goals. For each one, you'll see your current approach, a new technique to try, and why it matters.

### 1. Ask Bigger Questions Early

**Current pattern:** You focus on logistics and schedules early in calls.

> "Would you like to schedule our appointment? We can schedule it ahead of time."

**Try this:** Open with vision-oriented questions before diving into logistics.

> "Before we get into the details, I'm curious—what do you see yourself doing in 5 years? What kind of work really excites you?"

**Why it matters:** Big questions help clients think beyond their immediate situation and see you as a guide to their future, not just someone helping with paperwork.

### 2. Create Narratives About Clients' Futures

**Current pattern:** You capture information accurately.

**Try this:** Transform that information into an inspiring story and read it back.

Instead of just taking notes, try saying:

> "Let me read back what I'm hearing about your goals: 'John is rebuilding his career after a two-year gap. He's using this current position to demonstrate his reliability and work ethic while keeping his health a priority. His plan is to stay here for about a year, gain solid work experience, and then transition to a role with better benefits and higher pay. Through the Ticket to Work program, John is taking strategic steps toward long-term financial independence.'"

Then ask: "Does that capture where you're headed?"

**Why it matters:** When clients hear their story told back to them in professional, affirming language, they see themselves differently. They become someone with a plan, not just someone struggling.

### 3. Celebrate Wins More Enthusiastically

**Current pattern:** You acknowledge client situations.

> **Client:** "This place is bare minimum. There's no paid vacation..."
>
> **You:** "Oh, man, okay."

**Try this:** Reframe and celebrate the positive.

> "I hear you—the benefits aren't great. But here's what I'm excited about: you're working. You're building your work history. That matters. And we're going to use this as a stepping stone to something better."

When clients share good news, match their energy and add to it:

> "Oh, that's fantastic! Congratulations! That's a real milestone."

**Why it matters:** Clients often don't recognize their own progress. Your enthusiasm helps them see their wins as meaningful.

### 4. Challenge Clients Gently

**Current pattern:** You validate and support.

> "You're rebuilding your work experience. That counts for something, absolutely."

**Try this:** Add gentle accountability.

> "You're rebuilding your work experience—that's huge. Now here's my question: what's one thing you can do this month to prepare for that next step? Maybe update your resume, or research companies you'd want to work for?"

Other phrases to try:
- "You have to be ready for when that opportunity comes. What can we do now to make sure you're prepared?"
- "I love that goal. Have you started researching what it would take to get there?"
- "That's a great plan. What's your backup if this doesn't work out?"

**Why it matters:** Supportive validation feels good in the moment, but gentle challenge helps clients grow. The best coaches do both.

### 5. Take Full Ownership of Complex Conversations

**Current pattern:** You sometimes defer to Cynthia for benefits counseling.

> "We still have to schedule your benefits counseling meeting with my manager, Cynthia, because it'll help even clarify this even more."

**Try this:** Handle the full conversation yourself, and position yourself as the expert.

> "Let me walk you through exactly how this transition will work. I'll explain the trial work period, the extended eligibility period, and exactly what happens at each stage. By the end of this call, you'll know exactly where you stand."

**Why it matters:** You already know this material—you explained it thoroughly to John. Owning the conversation builds your credibility with clients and your confidence in yourself.

### 6. Use Identity-Affirming Language

**Current pattern:** Your descriptions are accurate and practical.

**Try this:** Use language that positions clients as people with aspirations and trajectories.

Instead of:
> "You're rebuilding your work experience."

Try:
> "You're someone who takes their career seriously. Even when the job isn't perfect, you're showing up and building toward something bigger."

Instead of:
> "That's the threshold amount."

Try:
> "You're learning to navigate a complex system—that's not easy, and you're doing it well."

**Why it matters:** The language we use shapes how clients see themselves. Identity-affirming language helps them internalize a positive self-image.

### 7. Turn Documentation Into Engagement

**Current pattern:** You take notes efficiently.

**Try this:** Make documentation a collaborative, engaging experience.

> "I'm writing down your goals right now. Let me read you what I've got: [read elaborate goal statement]. How does that sound? Is there anything you'd add?"

> "I want to make sure I capture this correctly because it's going into your file—this is your story. Here's what I have..."

**Why it matters:** When clients hear their goals written out professionally, it validates their aspirations and makes the bureaucratic process feel meaningful.

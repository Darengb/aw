[(350) 503-2285] {00:00:00}
Cheers.
Hello? Hello!

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:03}
Good morning, how are you? This is Kaitlin with America Works.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:00:07}
Good morning. I was just sending you a text.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:10}
I saw that, and I'm so sorry, I was just stuck on another call. Um… Oh, okay, no worries. Yeah, so let's see here. Let's open up your file here. Um, we were gonna do… your individual work plan today, right? We're gonna work on some goal setting.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:00:29}
Okay.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:30}
Okay, let's see here… Well, does he know anything about.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:00:38}
You know, I'm one of the world's top experts on that now.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:46}
Okay, look.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:00:48}
And you're at 5751 Riverdale Road, Atlanta, Georgia?
Yes.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:54}
Yes, okay. And what day of the month, again, do you receive your benefits? Was it on the 3rd?

[(350) 503-2285] {00:01:00}
No, on the first, but you know, I wanted to ask you a question in regard to that.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:06}
You'll be able to…

[(350) 503-2285] {00:01:07}
See, would you be able to look in there and see about overpayments?
Because I have a…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:13}
Oh, go ahead.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:01:14}
Because I had had a letter about an overpayment, but I was trying to get a hold of them, and I cannot get in contact with them, because for the simple fact is.
From the paperwork that they sent me, and it stated the date that they took… they were taking funds.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:29}
So, I'm.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:01:30}
I'm adding it all up, and it's like, okay, well, they shouldn't be taken anymore, but they send me another letter out saying, beginning this year, the first of this month, they were gonna be taking more money. I'm like, why are you taking more money?
all that you said that you're supposed to take, so I'm trying.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:48}
to see What could I do? Yeah.
Um, so, let me just see here, um… And do you have a MySSA.gov account?

[(350) 503-2285] {00:02:00}
Uh, I don't think I've set that up yet.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:02:03}
Um, because if you set one of those up, you have access to more information than I do, but what I would recommend is submitting what they call a BPQI, which is a Benefits Inquiry Report, um, request, and what that does is that that will outline, um.
Kind of all of, like.
all of the income they have on record for you to make sure… and we can cross-reference it and make sure that it's correct, because sometimes there are errors, right? And so… and that should outline it month by month, really, um, everything they have on file, um, and that would explain… and it would also include information about an overpayment, if you had one.
And… let's just see here, let me pull this up for you.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:02:47}
like $400. Okay, well, that's been taken care of, so it's not like.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:02:51}
Right. And so, the reason I say setting up a MySSA.gov account online, um, it's easiest to report your wages that way, but also, you just have more direct access to some information, um, versus You know, not having it, and have…
you know, there's some information you're gonna have to call to get, regardless, um, but you do have more access to stuff than I do. So I can't see an overpayment, I can't see… like, I can see if you made over a certain amount of money in the last 24 months, and I can't see beyond that, um, but I also can't see which months they're for, or, like, what your employer was.
or, um, I can, yeah, I can see, like, where… when your benefits have been in suspense, and when you've been actively receiving them. Um, but outside of that, that's all I can see.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:03:48}
Okay, well, this is what I'm about to say, okay, but I probably do have an account already, but there's no reporting of wages of working, because I don't work, I have not worked.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:03:58}
I don't know where this.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:04:00}
coming from? Did you have anything… you see anything saying that I'm receiving something?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:04:04}
Oh, let me just see, I can… I'll pull that up. Yeah, no, and they don't make things easy or straightforward, and they do make mistakes, and that's why when going back to work, it is, um, really beneficial to be with a service provider, so that not only are you reporting to Social Security, but that you're reporting to
me, so I can look in my report to say, hey, this is what we have, and then if they send you paperwork that you think is incorrect, we can.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:04:30}
cross-reference it, or if they don't put your benefits in suspense when they should, you know, I… I would flag that, and I would let you know, so that… They've been doing this for years, you know? They've been saying I've been They've been saying I've been doing stuff for years, like I have roofing companies, I did this and that, and I gave them all the information that I had not been doing any of it, but have they ever paid me back any of the money? No.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:04:53}
They just believe that.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:04:54}
and shouldn't.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:04:54}
You know.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:04:55}
ever did anything.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:04:56}
But they cost me.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:04:57}
taken from me.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:04:58}
They know I'm not.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:04:59}
working.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:05:00}
Right. Did you receive, like, um, I think it's Form BK821? Um, because that is a work activity report, and they would have requested information, and that's one way to kind of straighten out your account.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:05:14}
and a lot of those things.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:05:15}
For some reason…

[(350) 503-2285] {00:05:17}
A mess has been going on.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:05:19}
You know.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:05:19}
So I'm not understanding what this is about, and I'm just… I don't know…
Yeah, now I know about the $400, why that was took out. That was because when I stayed in California and I moved here, and I didn't know that it doesn't go, you know, together, it's two different things, so that's the only reason for $400. I don't know about anything else should be going on, because all that should be cleaned up.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:05:43}
Cleaned up, yeah. Okay, so let me just see here, um…

[(350) 503-2285] {00:05:46}
At least that's what they said when I went down there, and they know that it's not me that's been working and doing all this stuff that.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:05:54}
That's right.
Um, okay.
So…

[(350) 503-2285] {00:05:59}
be in this house day in and day out.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:06:03}
So, in the last 24 months, right, I can't see further back than that, it says you don't have any trial work level or greater. So, trial work level goes up a little bit every year. In 2026, it's going to be $1,210. In 2025, it was $1,160, and in 2024, I'm sure it was probably $1,110. Um, and… So what that means is that you didn't make over that at any point in time in the last 2 years. I can see here in… that…

[(350) 503-2285] {00:06:36}
You can bet.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:06:37}
You have been receiving pay consistently since October 2019, so you haven't been put into suspense.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:06:47}
I ain't done nothing. I don't understand.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:06:48}
Right, yeah, no, I don't understand why either. And it looks like maybe you were in suspense temporarily in 2016 and 2019. Those are the only times it looks like you were… I don't know for what reason. No, that's okay, I don't know for what reason. Because they were saying that I.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:07:09}
I had a business and a company, and I kept telling these people, but they just feel like they could just, you know…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:07:16}
Yeah, I'm so sorry. But let me just pull this paperwork together for you, and I'm going to send it to you, and what you should do is you should print it out and bring it, um, to your local Social Security office, and ask for them to print it out for you.
And for you to leave with it, not just to submit the paperwork, because Otherwise, it could take a few months to get. Um, so let me just pull this up for you. And you're… And your email… oh, what's… What's your email address?

[(350) 503-2285] {00:07:48}
You said you were gonna send it, but I'll just get, uh, A and, uh, Mabel G. Hempstead.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:07:55}
Mabel.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:07:58}
G. Hempstead?
Like, uh, black people… We'll close down.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:08:07}
Gmail.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:08:09}
Uh-huh.
So.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:08:12}
A-M-A-B-L-E-G-H-E-M-P-S-T-E-A-D at gmail.com.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:08:19}
Yes, ma'am.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:08:20}
Okay, just wanted to double check.
Alright, let's put this right in an email for you.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:08:32}
I'm gonna do it, God.com, or just as, uh, at gmail.
Sam's dead.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:08:46}
So, there are two sheets. Um, one is Form 3288, and then the other one is a, um.
a cover sheet, and what it does is it explains that you're working with us, um, and so they should not charge you for this report at all. You know, and it's interesting, because every time you talk to someone at Social Security.
they have different information, right? And so, just know that that's what the second… that cover page is for. It's just to say, look, you're working with us, and you're working with, you know, a benefits you know, a service provider with benefits counselors, you… should not be charged for this report. Um…

[(350) 503-2285] {00:09:27}
And they might not try rip, but just in case, it's always good to have. Alright, so let's do this. Put this in there.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:09:39}
That's great.
Oh, y'all.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:09:58}
When you went to a party, and your phone won was in the house?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:10:20}
And just so you know, on the, um, the SSA 3288, Squeak Stone, she is my supervisor, um, and that's why her name is on the form. So what they'll do is they'll give you a copy, hopefully you'll walk away with a copy, and then they'll also mail us a copy, but because she's a certified benefits counselor, that's why her name is on there. Um, and if they're
is anything in the report that doesn't make sense, that we can't make sense of, she'll be able to take a look at it with you, and um… make sure that, you know, you know the appropriate steps to take. Um, generally, when they're pretty straightforward, I can absolutely help you with that, not a problem. Um, but it's when, you know, things get a little convoluted, where I just refer, um.
you know, I'd refer you just to her for a benefits counseling session.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:11:09}
Right, right, exactly, thank you.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:11:11}
Yeah, and do you know where your local Social Security office is, or would you like me to pull that up for you?

[(350) 503-2285] {00:11:17}
I never even went, but I have, uh… I have the address.
You do? Okay. Yes, ma'am, I do.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:11:24}
Okay, here we go. I just sent that.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:11:27}
Just… just how they conduct certain things here is just…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:11:30}
appeared in his.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:11:31}
different. I mean, it just doesn't make sense. Yeah, of course.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:11:34}
I don't like it at all.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:11:36}
Oh.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:11:37}
I don't blame you. I had a lot of.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:11:39}
money, I would pack up and leave and move back to California.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:11:42}
Oh, really? What part of California were you living in?

[(350) 503-2285] {00:11:46}
No, it's irrelevant, but yeah.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:11:49}
Ugh. Um, let's see here, okay.
And do you have an emergency contact?

[(350) 503-2285] {00:11:56}
Uh, yes, I do. Why we need to do all this? Because the last time when I was… I did this, I didn't have to go through all this.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:12:04}
This is just the paperwork that… this is just the paperwork that, um… my… you know, that Social Security asks for, but also what America Works asks for as far as, um… like, enrollment paperwork. Every organization, you know, they have certain basic requirements, and every organization and company does things a little different. Um, but if you don't have one, that's fine. I just was… it's just one of the things on the form that they asked me to ask.
Okay. I have a few of them, bro.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:12:37}
But I don't, uh, wanna do all that right now.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:12:41}
Okay, not a problem, not a problem. And do you…

[(350) 503-2285] {00:12:45}
He wants me to put him down, but I'm not putting nobody down right now.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:12:49}
That's okay. Not a problem. Um… And… Are you interested in working on the rest of the enrollment paperwork, as far as, like, setting goals and stuff like that, or do you want to reschedule?

[(350) 503-2285] {00:13:05}
Um… I'm just… what I really would like to know is, um, what am I going to benefit out of this as far as getting myself together? Because before, when I did this, it was very good. It was prosperous, everything worked out really good.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:13:22}
But this smells.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:13:23}
product.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:13:24}
complete.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:13:24}
or something, I mean…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:13:26}
Oh, okay, so…

[(350) 503-2285] {00:13:27}
to do hands-on, we don't do video calls, we don't do nothing, it's just.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:13:31}
Horrible.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:13:31}
I was talking. I mean, I'm just…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:13:33}
We can absolutely… yeah, we can absolutely set up a video call, that's always an option. My apologies if I didn't offer that, it wasn't intentional. We can absolutely set up a video call, we can do, you know.
phone calls, video calls, whatever works for you. I'm based in Vermont, so in-person isn't an option, and we don't currently have an office in Georgia. Otherwise, I'd also be happy to refer you down there. Right.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:13:59}
Right.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:13:59}
That would be nice. Right, because I'm really…

[(350) 503-2285] {00:14:03}
Furious about trying to get something going here.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:14:05}
Yeah, absolutely.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:14:07}
I don't know how much help you could be to me from there.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:14:11}
I really need to get.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:14:12}
stuff done, what, you know, I'm just trying to see, but… So, you know, one of the things that we would do is we would, um.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:14:19}
We would work on your resume, we would get it all, you know, making sure that it's up to date, making sure that it is highlighting all of your, you know, skills regarding your candidacy for the types of jobs you're looking for. In order to enroll you, we would set up short and long-term goals, along with, um, some, uh, along with income goals.
Um, and then I would also outline in that paperwork, you know, the steps that I could
do to support you as far as helping you with resume, helping you with finding job leads, your job search strategy, helping you apply to jobs, you know, writing cover letters or preparing for interviews. We would check in every other week or so while you were looking for work, um, and we would have weekly… there are weekly webinars that you're welcome to take that are free.
That we offer every week, um… And, you know, I can… Provide you with external resources, or, uh, you know, as far as, um.
Helping you if you needed to request job accommodations that could help you, you know.
navigate that. Um, and then once you were… I could help you set up a MySSA.gov account if you don't have one. Um… I'd be able to help you with any paperwork, right? I'd be able to help you with any Social Security paperwork that you receive, right? Like, we have certified benefits counselors on staff, you know, all of those… all of those things.
are the things that I'd be able to do to… to help you, and support you, and help you… Okay.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:15:51}
Okay, excuse me. Okay, as far as you said, like, that paperwork, if I really needed the help or something, I mean, how would I get that done? I would have to send stuff over to you, or then you gotta get it back to me, or, I mean, how is this supposed to happen?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:16:04}
So, depending on what the… yeah, depending on what the paperwork was from Social Security, you could tell me what form it was, we could discuss it over the phone, you could show me in a video call, I could, um, you know, help you fill it out, let you know, like.
What it's for? I already did that, okay.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:16:24}
Yeah, pretty much everything. There's something I did it myself, and I thank God for it. I'm just…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:16:30}
Yo!

[(350) 503-2285] {00:16:32}
Ugh, I just need something, like, local, because I want to get out, I want to be interactive with the person that's, you know, supposed to be helping me get stuff going.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:16:41}
Oh, I…

[(350) 503-2285] {00:16:41}
the phone, and I just need… Yeah.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:16:45}
Alright, so… Do you want me to look up to see if there are other local organizations near you that might be a better fit that you could go in person to?

[(350) 503-2285] {00:16:53}
Yes, ma'am, could you? That would really be nice.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:16:56}
Absolutely. Like, I'm here to help, you know? Like, I want to make sure that your needs are being met, you know? That's what's most important to me.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:17:07}
Because I'm really trying to get this done, but…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:17:09}
Of course. Okay, let's just see here.
Um…

[(350) 503-2285] {00:17:17}
do something.
If I need to go to some kind of training for a job, or some…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:17:24}
And I just…

[(350) 503-2285] {00:17:25}
That would be something.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:17:27}
Of course.
Of course.
Let's see here… Oh, God.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:17:35}
Someone that's really, really wants to really help, and not just saying, and then they, you know, they don't, you know, uh, because there's so much going on.
No. People don't want to really help people get on their feet and get going.
I'm not really serious about this.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:17:53}
Yeah, I have no… I have no doubt. You certainly sound it, and I'm… That's why I called.
Like, wait a minute.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:18:01}
She hasn't called yet, um, I'm really curious about this, so I'm gonna reach out to her this morning.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:18:07}
Alright, let's see here. So, we have…

[(350) 503-2285] {00:18:35}
I'm so ready, I mean, I would even try to help volunteer, just something, I need to do something.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:18:40}
Yeah, absolutely. Um…

[(350) 503-2285] {00:18:53}
Too bad you don't know anyone in Atlanta, huh?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:18:57}
So, yeah, I'm sorry we don't have anyone in Atlanta. We did, but, um… they ended up moving on, and so I don't think that we've… we have anyone currently down there. I know that that's ultimately our goal, but… Um, at the moment, we don't. Um, so there's an organization called… it's an employment network, um, it's called Ability Solutions, um, and uh, they have… also, they have certified benefits counselors on staff, um, they have, um.
You know, career services, they're… they're an employment network, they have, um… they have employability training, um, and I can send you this information. And so they, they are a national company, but they do have, uh.
an Atlanta office, and it says right here, when I looked up on the Choose Work website, that they have in-person and virtual, um, services. So, they have both. Um, and so I can send you all that information. Let me just pull it up in an email for you, okay?

[(350) 503-2285] {00:20:00}
Thank you, that's wonderful, and then can you send it in a text, too, for me?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:20:04}
Just in case that'll…

[(350) 503-2285] {00:20:05}
Okay, and is it with the, uh, Ticket to Work program, or no?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:20:10}
Yep, so all employment networks run Ticket to Work. Um…

[(350) 503-2285] {00:20:14}
Please.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:20:15}
So not a staffing firm, but an employment network, so it's a little different. I don't know if they do direct placement. Some employment networks do. AmericaWorks doesn't, um, but I know that everyone runs things slightly differently. Right, right, right. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so this person's name is April Watson-Horton, Uh-oh.
Let's see…

[(350) 503-2285] {00:20:39}
I'm gonna text that I.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:20:40}
I'm gonna send it all, I'm gonna send it all to you, not a problem. Okay, April, okay. Okay, Lord. This is a Spartan.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:20:48}
you know.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:20:53}
So I'll make sure I give you all that. Still, every now and then.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:20:55}
And when I need to talk or something, would I be able to reach out to you, or this should help me with here?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:21:01}
This is… they should be able to help you, you know, as… like, you can't be enrolled with more than one employee in the network at a time. Okay, okay.
Certainly, if, you know, you change your mind, and, you know, you think that you do… you think that virtual services could help you, I'm more than happy to set up another call to enroll you. Wonderful. But again, I don't want to enroll you if it's not going to meet your needs, you know? Right, right. You know, I want your… I want to…
Make sure that your needs are getting supported. That's my end goal.
Yes, ma'am.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:21:36}
I appreciate that.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:21:38}
I really do. Yeah.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:21:40}
It's hard to come by. They say one thing, they do another, but I'm really serious about what I'm trying to get.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:21:46}
Absolutely. So here, I've got the website listed for you, her name, the phone number, and the address. Um, and I'm going to put it in an email and a text message to you, okay? Wonderful, thank you.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:21:56}
Thank you so much.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:21:57}
Of course. Here.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:22:02}
What do you see?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:22:08}
Oh, okay, that might be why.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:22:20}
I just… it's just… I just wish I just knew how to really get around here a little bit more. I just don't really know. I haven't been here that long.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:22:30}
Oh, how long have you been there?

[(350) 503-2285] {00:22:32}
Yeah, I'm just trying to get it together.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:22:36}
One day at a time.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:22:37}
But in this new year, something good and positive is gonna come out of it. It's just gotta put in a little work.
Yeah, I'll try to put a little bit of work, so…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:22:48}
Let's just see here.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:22:49}
better to take that first step, he'll take the rest, so I'm just trying to get something going here.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:22:55}
Alright, so I just sent that over to you in a text and an email. Can… did you get the text?

[(350) 503-2285] {00:23:01}
Yes, ma'am, I got the text, but now I'm looking for the… Email, and I…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:23:07}
Oh, that's good.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:23:08}
It's in there, but for sure, I most definitely did get that, um… What in the world?
I got the text.
I tried to make me a new email, because I got tired of using her email. She has too, but… I was using her old one.
I'm gonna sit.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:23:33}
Why did that not go through? Let's see here, let me try that again.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:23:37}
Uh, what, the email?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:23:39}
email, yeah, because I'm not… it's not showing up here, um, even though… It's not showing up on my phone.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:23:43}
either. So, I'll just… maybe I'll give you my old one.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:23:48}
Oh, let me try one more thing.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:23:50}
Okay, and if it don't go through, I'll give you my old one until I get my new one set up.
That's weird.
Cause I didn't get anything either.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:24:02}
Let's see. That is weird. That is weird, let me just see, because I did just update it.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:24:12}
Nope, nothing.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:24:15}
Um…

[(350) 503-2285] {00:24:19}
On my phone, device, iCloud, uh… Nope, nothing.
Ain't that something?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:24:29}
Oh, you said it's… it's A. Mabel G. Hempstead?

[(350) 503-2285] {00:24:34}
Mm-hmm.
I didn't get nothing either, and I…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:24:40}
Let me try one more thing, let's see if this'll work, okay?
Um…

[(350) 503-2285] {00:24:45}
If it does it, I guess I'll just have to use…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:24:48}
Oh, and not just one.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:24:50}
to try to do everything new. I didn't want to…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:24:53}
I said, geez, nobody.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:24:54}
Nothing.
All my own stuff.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:25:01}
Yeah, I don't blame you.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:25:04}
Wow. Show this again.
Well, if it don't go in the email, that's okay, I got it in my text, though.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:25:11}
You do, but let's just see, maybe this one went through.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:25:19}
That's when somebody else getting it, cause it ain't coming to me.
Did it say fail, or did it go through?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:25:26}
It did say failed, which is just odd.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:25:29}
Yeah, exactly. So I'll just settle for my, um… The text, that's a blessing by itself.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:25:36}
Know what's going on.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:25:37}
I tell you, every time I try to get something set up for myself, or something get.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:25:41}
Oh, it's all.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:25:42}
always this.
But it's okay, it's not gonna stop me, I'm gonna continue to pursue, I'm gonna continue to…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:25:49}
Yeah, it bounced back again, yeah. Well, best of luck to you.
Yeah, best of luck, and again, you have my contact info, so if, you know, anything changes, or, you know, I can enroll you and, you know, you're looking for help, just reach out, okay?

[(350) 503-2285] {00:26:06}
Yes, ma'am, I, you know, I just might, but I'm gonna reach out to this other one. I'm gonna wait another day, I'm not gonna do it today.
I'm just gonna wait. I'm gonna pray on it, and I'm gonna wait till I feel it in my spirit, and then I will reach out to this young lady, or whoever she is, and see.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:26:22}
Yeah.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:26:23}
love to offer.
Well, best of luck to you, and I hope you have a great 2026.
Yes, ma'am, you as well.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:26:31}
Thanks so much. Bye now.

[(350) 503-2285] {00:26:32}
So, just be looking forward to hearing from me again, because I just might reach back out.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:26:36}
Please do! Like I said, I'm happy to, okay?

[(350) 503-2285] {00:26:40}
Okay, thank you, ma'am, so much.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:26:42}
You're welcome. Have a great day. Bye.

Thank you, bye-bye.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:00:00}
Hello, Monique.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:02}
Good morning, Nadine. Happy Holidays, Happy New Year.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:00:06}
MGMA Danny.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:07}
How are you doing?

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:00:09}
I am good. I'm here, so I'm giving thanks.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:12}
Amen, amen, that's all we can do.
We have to be… we have to be thankful.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:00:19}
That's everything. Yes.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:23}
Everything we have to give thanks.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:00:28}
We're catching up. You're back right now? Yes, ma'am. Okay. Yes, just checking in.
Um, it's a lot going on since we…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:44}
Hello?

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:00:47}
I was saying, it's a lot going on since we spoke.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:51}
Okay.
Um…

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:00:54}
Should I call it? I don't know if you're spelled. I've been sending in the stops, so…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:00:58}
Mhm.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:00:59}
Um, I don't know if you saw my last email to you, or… I'm going through any of them? I'm going through all of your emails right now.
Yeah, the last one I sent to you is regarding the Social Security, um, overpayment.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:17}
Okay.
Before they send you an overpayment letter, they send you a letter letting you know that your payments should be suspended.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:01:29}
Um, yeah, I got that, I'm not worried about things.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:32}
friend there.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:01:33}
Um, I don't…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:34}
So you get that letter before the overpayment. So, when you get the suspension letter, that is Social Security letting you know that you're… you should no longer be receiving your cash payments due to your, um… earnings from working.
And if they are… Yeah, I got that.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:01:52}
I sent that to you as well, and you.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:01:54}
thinking, because…

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:01:55}
um, what I'm saying is this. If I'm sending my paystubs to them.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:00}
So you are saying…

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:02:01}
ending my pay subsid them.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:03}
How the hell can they order?

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:02:04}
overpayment.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:05}
And then you're gonna.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:02:05}
Let's say I need to pay you back.
Where may I get that from?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:10}
Yeah. How much are they stating that you…

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:02:13}
$6,000.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:15}
Okay, so what we'll do is we're gonna fill out an overpayment, um… Waiver request form.
And we're gonna let them know that they have been receiving the pay stubs.
And, um That you cannot afford to pay them all of that back.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:02:34}
I, I did a, I did the, um, there was a form that they sent in with the paper they were saying to do. I filled out the form, actually, and um… Aye.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:44}
So now you're waiting to hear back from them.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:02:47}
I'm just gonna… I was gonna just drop it in the mail today, right?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:51}
I was… it's an appeal.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:02:52}
Is that what you call it?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:02:53}
Yes. Well, it depends. You can appeal it, or you can request, um… a waiver.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:03:04}
So it depends on which one? He only gave me a form. He only gave me an option for a form to appeal, and under appeal, you pick… it picks, um, like, a review.
informal something. Informal, uh… to review. One is that they review it again, and then there's one that's an informal, um.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:03:25}
Mm-hmm. In farmer's view.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:03:26}
So I don't know, should I still drop that, or do you just do that waiver?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:03:32}
You decide which one you want to do. I can't tell you which one to do, unfortunately. But which one is the better?

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:03:39}
Because when you do the waiver, what does the waiver say?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:03:42}
So you can… you can request a waiver.
And if, um, they come back with a decision that, um, you have to pay, then after the waiver is done, then you can, um.
Appeal that decision.
But you don't normally, you don't just go straight to the appeal without having a waiver done first.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:04:06}
And that is a C… that is what these people do, because they did not say that in the letter. They only.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:13}
They told it's two ways.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:04:14}
to do it. Pay the money by the 25th of December, which I didn't even get the letter, to be honest. I didn't even.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:20}
You didn't even get the letter in time, correct?

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:04:22}
They may have sent it, I'm not saying no, because I.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:26}
Know how to mail it.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:04:27}
But I did not see the letter until Christmas time.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:30}
Right.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:04:31}
So, I'm just saying, and they did not give you an option for that. All they had in there was that the files form such and such.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:37}
I'll peel it.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:04:38}
They did not tell you anything about a waiver, so…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:41}
I would suggest.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:04:42}
I would go with the waiver with you on first, and see what happens with them.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:47}
It's just ridiculous.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:04:48}
less.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:04:48}
So I… when do you have time? I can actually, um, I'll email you the waiver, and then whenever you have time, I can go over it, um, with you.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:05:01}
And help you fill it out.
Alright, well, I mean, you can send it to me right now, that's fine. Um, then I'll just, if I need any… if I have any issues with it, then I'll just, you know, call you back. But you can send…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:05:13}
Send it to me now.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:05:14}
Um, thing, but… It's too much. It's too much.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:05:18}
Yeah.
That, unfortunately, is very sad, but this is something that, um.
They do too many times to a lot… not just yourself.
And we try to catch them.
And… Ahead of time, but sometimes I miss it.
from them, because I don't get the letters from them. They send it directly to the clients.
SSA. Overpayment… Waiver request.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:05:51}
And, um, I'm really trying to, you know, I'm looking online, I'm searching for something remote.
part-time, um, in supplements, because there are so many things that is happening, and I know now that I'm out of the… pretty much out of the system, then they also sent me now that my… well, maybe you don't have anything to do with that. Now they're saying that my Medicaid is… um, they're gonna do without Medicaid and all that kind of stuff. So that's fine. Let them take whatever they're in, because I'm out of the system, I don't have to really deal with whatever they're doing.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:06:24}
Oh, yo, um… Your Medicaid, your annual income, you're not probably over the threshold.
For, uh, Medicaid… So I don't understand what they're talking about.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:06:38}
Yeah, they send that so that that's not… then they sent me a big, um… Like, a big bill to pay for, to continue.
some Medicare or whatever, but again, I'm not… I'm just saying that let me get out of their system and off of their radar, then I'm done. Let me deal with myself, what I have to do. Because I asked them, I was trying to get them to stop the…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:03}
payments from the.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:07:04}
before, right? And I remember, I think, um, you had said to me that it's not something that I can do like that. Um, they're the ones that have to make the claim. Now they overpay me, now they want me to do that. So I'm just like… Enough. Enough.
So, well, the ticket to work part that I'm in now, where does that go? The ticket to work basically just helped me to get back to the point where I can help myself, correct?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:07:34}
Yeah, you're still in the Ticket to Work program, like, when it's issues like these with Social Security, I'm here to assist you through it.
And, um… anything else that Social Security, um, does, as long as you keep me updated with it. And then, um, whatever decision they decide after this form is when you do the, um, appeal.
And then after the, um, appeal, we'll see what they say. But you will want to go through this first, um, doing the overpayment, um, waiver.
Just too much.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:08:20}
They're just too much.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:22}
Yeah, so… Yeah, so I'm here.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:08:24}
I'm trying to find something.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:25}
Singap.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:08:26}
time, remote.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:27}
points.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:08:27}
And, um, because even though I was supposed to start back school this semester, no, I can't do all of that, because…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:34}
Everything is just…

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:08:36}
You know, but again, one step at a time, so…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:39}
You were getting SSDI, right?

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:08:42}
I have a social security disability, yeah.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:08:44}
Mm-hmm, access to that payments.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:08:50}
And that's it, so… Um… Yeah.
Yeah, so I really want to do something part-time, so I'm searching online, too.
To get something remote.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:09:35}
What's the date of this notice?
November 24th?
24.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:09:50}
David Clemson, hold on…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:11:11}
I just sent you a copy of the form.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:11:15}
Okay.
Thank you.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:12:10}
Did you get the form?

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:12:13}
I'm searching.
Yes, I see an email.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:12:18}
Okay, so on the form… You're gonna complete it, um, with your information, and then in Section 2, you're gonna select All three, A, B, and C, and you're gonna put… I have been given my social, um, I have been given my copies of my pay stubs to, um, Social Security monthly.
And the Social Security representative says that I'm still entitled to receive my SSDI payments.
This overpayment is not my fault.
When I've been reporting…

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:12:57}
In Section 2, I'm selecting A.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:13:00}
A, B, and C.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:13:02}
all of them.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:13:04}
Yes.
And you're gonna put… I've been reporting my wages to Social Security monthly with copies of my pay stubs.
And the SSA representative says that I am still entitled to receive my SSDI payments. This overpayment is not my fault when I have been reporting my wages monthly.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:13:26}
Okay.
Awesome.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:13:31}
The date on the… on the letter is November, um, 24.
And, um, in Section 5, you will put the same thing.
I'm reporting my wages monthly to Social Security, and I'm being told I'm entitled to my, um, benefit… SSDI benefits.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:13:53}
And where do you put that in Section 5? Section 5 doesn't have any space for that.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:13:59}
Yes, it does. It says, tell us what you know about the over… why the overpayment, um, may have happened. There are 3 lines.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:14:06}
Oh, hold on, Section 5, Resources.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:14:09}
Not section 5, number 5, I'm sorry.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:14:13}
Oh, okay, hold on.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:14:15}
We're still in Section 2, number 5, I'm sorry.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:14:20}
Okay.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:14:22}
And then, um… Section 6 is if you have any dependents, you will put that information there.
Um, Section 4 is in regards to your household.
Section 5, they're asking for information in regards to your bank accounts.
Because you have to show that you cannot pay the money back.
Section, um, number 9 is asking if you own a vehicle.
The main purpose is for you to get to… used to go to work.
Everything else is self-explanatory, um, for you to answer.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:15:21}
Okay.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:15:22}
Because that's your personal information that I don't, um, have. I don't know all of that.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:15:38}
Let me ask you one question. In Section 7.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:15:42}
Mm-hmm.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:15:43}
Give me about my rent or my mortgage, okay?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:15:46}
Mhm.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:15:46}
And then I put that in there as of now.
Before, I didn't have one. I thought, no, I do.
Right?

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:15:54}
Same house. Mortgage?

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:15:56}
Which, yeah.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:15:57}
Yes, you put that there.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:15:59}
And I put that there, um…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:16:03}
Everyone is gonna tell us.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:16:05}
Let alone…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:16:05}
No, I don't…

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:16:06}
Problem with that.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:16:07}
selling their money.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:16:07}
I'm saying that alone is going to show them that I can't afford to pay what they're asking me.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:16:12}
Exactly.
That's the whole purpose of this form.
It's to show that you cannot afford to pay it back.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:16:20}
Yep.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:16:22}
Okay, and congratulations on your home.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:16:25}
I don't even know it's in the process of right now, to be honest.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:16:29}
I just…

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:16:30}
The first month was December.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:16:32}
And it's on the…

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:16:33}
It's a trial that I'm getting for 6 months.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:16:36}
Hmm…

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:16:37}
So, I just have to use that. I've been fighting this for over 10 years.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:16:42}
Oh my gosh.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:16:45}
But, um, haven't been working and haven't been doing of that, everything came together, and it's just been a… so I've been really fighting. So I just, uh… Just got this, what do they call it? Loan modification.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:17:02}
Okay.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:17:03}
And, um… They're giving me a trial for 6 months, so…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:17:07}
Okay, okay.
Awesome.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:17:13}
So it has been a… that's what I'm just saying, this is…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:17:16}
Just one more thing.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:17:17}
Added to it.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:17:20}
No, you understand.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:17:20}
That's why I said, I really need to find something remote and something.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:17:24}
part-time.
Yeah, but we want to, um… we don't want to add any extra income on this form. I mean, I can help you with that, but we want to get this form out to them first and let them review it, let them, you know, do what they need to do before… Um, we start getting something else, because we don't want them to say, oh, well, you sent us this form, and you did not disclose that you were working this part-time job.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:17:50}
Yeah, I'm gonna print them… try and print it and see if I can get…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:17:54}
setting up.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:17:56}
Oh my god.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:17:56}
It cannot.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:17:57}
I'll send it back to you, Peter.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:18:00}
Okay.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:18:01}
My technology stopped working today.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:18:04}
My schedule is 8.30 to 4.30, Monday through Friday.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:18:08}
Oh, okay.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:18:10}
Okay, so if you need to call me back… Oh, the form doesn't…

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:18:12}
It doesn't allow me to print, just because it's a PDF.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:18:16}
Yeah, you could print it.
And you can write on it.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:18:22}
loaded, and…

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:18:24}
Yes, and then you can print it.
Because then you're gonna print it and, um, mail it to your, um, Social Security office.
Or drop it in to their office, whichever one.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:18:40}
Okay.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:18:41}
Okay?

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:18:42}
Alright, man.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:18:43}
Let me get on that.

[Nadine Moulton-Soares] {00:18:44}
And, um, we'll talk more later.

[Cynthia Wilson] {00:18:47}
Alright then. Bye-bye. Blessings. Bye-bye.

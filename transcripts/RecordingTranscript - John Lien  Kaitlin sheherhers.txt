[John Lien] {00:00:01}
Hello.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:03}
Hi, sorry, I don't know what happened. Could you hear me? Because I stopped being able to hear you.

[John Lien] {00:00:08}
I hear you now.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:10}
Same.
Um… So, were you okay with working on Christmas?

[John Lien] {00:00:21}
I couldn't get away, because nobody else wanted… I, I posted it on… I tried giving away this when I asked for it.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:31}
Did you at least get paid time and a half for a holiday?

[John Lien] {00:00:34}
Yeah.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:35}
That's good, but I'm sorry about that.
Since you didn't want to.

[John Lien] {00:00:42}
I should have blocked it, I should have blocked it.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:46}
Who should've what?
locked it? Oh, are you able to do that with the schedule?

[John Lien] {00:00:53}
Yeah.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:56}
Um, thanks for sending your pay stubs, I appreciate that. Um… Let's see… See if we can find anything today, um…

[John Lien] {00:01:08}
Uh, likely, you're always on top of things.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:12}
to me?
I may have given you the wrong impression.

[John Lien] {00:01:23}
It's not, it's all organized.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:25}
Yeah, no, definitely not.
My mother's visiting, and my daughter, she's, um, 11, and she's… A piece of work. That's a good way to put it.
Um…

[John Lien] {00:01:39}
Keeps you busy.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:42}
She, uh, 100% does.
And… She was, like, mocking me as we were playing a game.
And she was like, And she did it, like, in this really patronizing voice, and she's like, well… I just… I just really think you have it all together. She's like, you're just really thriving at 44. And I was like, stop being a punk, you're awful. And then my mother looks at my daughter and goes, what's your base of reference? And I was like, the both of you are horrible people.
I'm like, the two of you, unbelievable.
Go ahead.

[John Lien] {00:02:29}
They have a great family.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:02:31}
We do, you know, it's still family. I mean, Isabella is amazing, and my mother is too, but, you know, you know how it is with families. More than one thing can be true. That's what I like to say. More than one thing can be true at a time.
They're pretty funny, though.
My mother took my daughter up north to go see, like, a holiday light thing, and it's kind of a long drive, and so they stopped and had something to eat, and my mother sends me a video.
And… of them at the restaurant. And, granted.
My mother is taking my daughter out to eat, and my daughter is clearly doing impressions of my mother and her boyfriend.
at the table. I was like, next time you tell her to be nice, or she's just gonna have to sit and watch while you go out to eat, like… I was like, don't tolerate that.
to Canada? No, it's not Canada, it's just right below. It's just a few minutes… it's a few miles south of, um, Burlington, which is Vermont's biggest city. Um, and we're all the way in the northeast Oh, no, I'm sorry, the southeast part of the state, and it's all… it's kind of up in the northwest part of the state, so it's a… it's a good two and a half hour drive.

[John Lien] {00:03:53}
Oh, nice. Yeah, and my mom retired this year, so she has the time to take her to do things.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:04:00}
Which is nice. But I'm like, what a punk, making fun of you while you take her out to eat? Like, wow! It's like, I can't imagine being so bold. Were you like that?

[John Lien] {00:04:13}
Were you like that as a child?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:04:16}
Huh? Nope.
not with the same level… differently. You know, she's… She's quite bright, and um… like, on a different level than I ever was.
And so it's hard to keep up, her brain goes so fast.

[John Lien] {00:04:32}
Is it, like, sassy? Is it, like, really sassy?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:04:35}
It's very sassy. It's very sassy. It's very quick, like, half the time, it's 5 minutes later, and then I get the joke.
You know, like, there's, like, a real lag time on my ability to understand how quick her mind is going.
Oh.
But to be honest.
she wasn't wrong. I mean, she… she wasn't really far off as far as, like, the impressions went of my mother and her boyfriend. I mean, she kind of nailed it, I'm not gonna lie.
Oh, yeah, it was pretty funny. Are you close to… Rancho Santiago Community College District? Santa Ana?

[John Lien] {00:05:18}
Yeah, that's… that's in my county.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:05:22}
Yeah, they have a job.

[John Lien] {00:05:25}
Yes, hi there.
I've tried that many times.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:05:29}
Well, it looks like they just posted another one, so maybe another time. About… let's see here. Um, this one is… Where is it?
It's an administrative clerk position, but now I can't find it. Where is it?
Uh, employment.

[John Lien] {00:05:46}
Title IX, or Title VI?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:05:49}
Let me see.

[John Lien] {00:06:08}
I think I saw that last week.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:06:10}
We have dough.
You don't speak Spanish or Vietnamese, do you?

[John Lien] {00:06:18}
No.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:06:19}
Me neither. That's fair me either. I just figured I'd ask, because they also had an admissions and records specialist.
But the administrative clerk is… Let's see here… They posted on the 19th of December.
And it is…

[John Lien] {00:06:46}
I wrote.
I got bilateral.
Sometimes over many times.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:06:55}
I would say redo your cover letter, and when was the last time you applied? Did you… have you applied since you've really worked on your materials?

[John Lien] {00:07:05}
I think international… the… I had part of it a few months ago.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:07:14}
Yeah, well…

[John Lien] {00:07:15}
The last interview I had was, like, 2 years ago.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:07:19}
Okay, let's see here. This is… I think you should apply to this one.
Um… Why is it not letting me copy the link?
That makes me really mad.
Here we go. That is much better.

[John Lien] {00:07:56}
Not sure.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:07:56}
Cleaner. Okay, this is… Alright, I'm gonna send this one over to you while I try to find some others.
for you to take a look at. Okay, so there's that.
Cal State Fullerton's hiring a administrative support coordinator for Biochem and Chemistry Lab.
Did you see that one?

[John Lien] {00:09:04}
I, I don't… hmm… A copy of it for the website.
Maybe a month.
I'm discouraged.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:09:17}
Yeah, I understand.
Here, let's see here.
Pull it up.

[John Lien] {00:09:23}
And they also… they were hiring for, uh, an advisor.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:09:32}
Did you apply for that?

[John Lien] {00:09:35}
No.
Because, uh, last time, uh, last month.
I wanted to apply, but then it says, uh, application already has been submitted.
Uh, can resubmit.
And I saw that there's a new… Drive.

Hello?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:04}
Hi, good morning, may I speak to Christy Lee Hembree, please?

[(864) 208-5512] {00:00:07}
This is true.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:09}
Hi, Christine, my name is Ana Arvelo from America Works with the Ticket to Work program. How are you this morning?

[(864) 208-5512] {00:00:15}
I'm good.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:16}
Good to hear. Um, and are you currently looking for employment?

[(864) 208-5512] {00:00:21}
Yes.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:23}
You are. Okay, are you looking for full-time or part-time employment?

[(864) 208-5512] {00:00:26}
That's true.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:28}
For a time. Alright, Christy, are you on SSI or SSDI?

[(864) 208-5512] {00:00:32}
so far.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:33}
an SSI. Okay, and are you open to becoming independent of your SSI benefits in the future when you find full-time employment?

[(864) 208-5512] {00:00:41}
Yes.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:42}
Okay, great.
And are you between the ages of 18 to 64?

[(864) 208-5512] {00:00:48}
Yes.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:49}
Yes, okay, great.
And do you know if you're working with another employment network at this time to assist you with this?

[(864) 208-5512] {00:00:57}
No.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:58}
No. Okay.
Not working. Ray. Have you worked within the last 5 years?

[(864) 208-5512] {00:01:05}
F.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:06}
Okay, great.
What was your last employment?

[(864) 208-5512] {00:01:11}
Um, uh, uh, Carolina Center for Recovery?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:17}
I'm sorry?

[(864) 208-5512] {00:01:19}
Carolina Center for Recovery.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:22}
Okay, gotcha.
Carolina Center of Full Recovery.
Okay, gotcha. Alright, so the next thing I need to do, um, Christy, is look up to see if you are eligible for Ticket to Work. Um, would you mind if I, um, ran your information in the Ticket to Work portal, just to see if you qualify?

[(864) 208-5512] {00:01:44}
Because…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:45}
Okay, great, one moment.
Okay, and what is your social security number, so I can check you in the portal?

[(864) 208-5512] {00:02:23}
I don't know about giving it out on the phone.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:02:27}
I understand. Um, if you'd like, I can help you verify who we are, um, by having you verify us on the Ticket to Work website, if that would be helpful.
Yep, no problem. Alright, so you would go to… do you have, um, internet access on your phone or a computer that you can look this up?

[(864) 208-5512] {00:02:49}
Yes.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:02:50}
Okay, so I want you to type in CHOOSE WORK.
dot SSA.gov.

[(864) 208-5512] {00:03:04}
the work.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:03:06}
Choose work. Uh, so C-H… Mm-hmm, C-H-O-O, S like Sam, E, work, as in work.
dot SSA.gov.
And you let me know when you get to that page.
This is the official Ticket to Work website, and I'll be helping you just verify, um, our company, Americaworks.
As one of the providers listed.

[(864) 208-5512] {00:03:41}
Okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:03:42}
Okay.

[(864) 208-5512] {00:03:43}
I don't know.
So, I'll just go ahead and give it to you.
Um, it's too fast, you know?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:03:50}
One second, I'm sorry, I didn't have the page open. Okay, I'm ready.

[(864) 208-5512] {00:03:56}
It's not zero.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:03:59}
Mhm.

[(864) 208-5512] {00:04:01}
burdens.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:03}
Mhm.

[(864) 208-5512] {00:04:04}
0, 0.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:08}
Alright, thank you.
Okay, I'm checking you in the official Social Security Ticket to Work portal, and it states, um… Hmm.
Mm-mm.
Okay, it says you're currently not in pay status. Are you, um, still receiving payments from Social Security?

[(864) 208-5512] {00:04:41}
Yes.
You are.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:42}
I'm the only…

[(864) 208-5512] {00:04:43}
I'm not on SSA.
I'm alone.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:46}
necessarily.

[(864) 208-5512] {00:04:47}
Fuhrer.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:49}
SSI, and you're receiving payments.

[(864) 208-5512] {00:04:51}
Yes. Okay, because the portal says, um.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:55}
That you're not currently receiving payment.
That could be incorrect, sometimes the portal is not accurate 100%, but, um, it does show that you're not in pay status right now.

[(864) 208-5512] {00:05:08}
Oof.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:05:10}
Okay, so, um, if you wanted to find out more about that and why that's the case, you could always call the, um, Social Security main line. Uh, would you like that number so you can call?

[(864) 208-5512] {00:05:21}
I've got it.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:05:22}
You've got it. Okay, well, thank you for your time, Christy. Best of luck on your journey. Okay, bye-bye.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:00:00}
Hello.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:02}
Hello, Anthony Atenna from America Works. How are you? How you doing?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:00:05}
I'm alright.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:06}
I'm good, I'm good. Are you still available for your intake today? Yes. Okay, good. Yes, I am. Awesome. So the good news is that you had already done a lot of your intake with Ms. Adrian when you guys last spoke.
So what I'll be doing is just going over what you guys went over, and you let me know if there's been any changes that you want to make to your goals, okay?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:00:28}
Mark.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:00:30}
Alright, perfect.
Mm-hmm.
Alright, let me just first, I'll review… I'm gonna change it from her name to mine. Her name is Adrienne. I'm Ana, so I'm changing that in the system.
And also, um, please save my number, because sometimes when we call, unfortunately, it comes up as spam, which is annoying. Oh, no. Yeah, so it's better that you, um, just save it under my name, so that way you know it's us calling you.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:01:04}
Okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:05}
Mm-hmm, and my name is Ana Arvelo.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:01:08}

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:09}
Mhm.
To get to work.
Yep, and that's, uh, 929-306-6619.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:01:17}
I got it. Perfect. And then my email is arvelo, like my last name, at americawworks.com.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:25}
Mm, okay?
Okay, so that's that first part.
Alright, so Adrienne went over all your last employment, so I'm just gonna review what she wrote. Um, she stated that you stated you worked at Hamill Construction as a forklift operator from 9-1-2021 to 12-1-2021, is that correct?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:01:54}
That is, man and.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:01:56}
Nobody's…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:01:58}
It's man… it's man and Hamill, M-A-N-N, and then Hamel.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:02:04}
Oh, and the and signed, and howl? Yeah. Man and howl. Okay, got it. I will change that.
Let me make sure I'm spelling it right… Oh, Hummel. H-U-M-M-E-L? Yes. Yup, okay. It was spelled a little different. Let me change that.
Man and Hummel Construction.
Yep, I see it here.
Alright, and um, you reported that your hourly wage was $19.54?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:02:42}
That's the world.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:02:43}
Mm-hmm, weekly hours 42.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:02:46}
Yes.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:02:47}
Awesome.
Okay, and then the… Job after Zah, or before that, was A D U… ADUs? ADUs?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:02:58}
Old?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:02:59}
Uh, it says ADUS.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:03:04}
ADUS.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:03:06}
And the title was Groundsman.
Maybe she missed it. Oh…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:03:11}
It should have been, uh… that was at the, um… Railroad companies.
In, uh, North Carolina. Oh, and what was it called?
I can't remember the name of it. That might be… that might be what it is.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:03:24}
Oh, ADUS. Okay, so I'll leave… I'll put a parentheses Railroad Company, so I know what that is. Okay?
No problem. Federal company, and the wage there was $18 an hour? 40 hours a week? Okay.
March 2021 to… August 31st, 2021.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:03:46}
Yes.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:03:47}
Alright.
And then the one buff… the last one that was reported here was Heidelberg Materials.
Yes. Mm-hmm. Well, Heidelberg is a.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:03:57}
uh, is a, uh… Distributor.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:01}
Wine and beer that you'.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:04:02}
Yep.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:03}
Kind of beer.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:04:04}
You're serious.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:05}
Distributor. You got it. I'll put that there.
Um…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:04:15}
Before that, was train.
HVAC company.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:19}
Oh, I don't have that one listed, so I'll go ahead and list that, just give me one second. It's quite a few.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:04:24}
It's Clara Fubi football, not like.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:26}
that, Clark.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:04:26}
But… mhm.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:27}
Yeah, so we can focus on the last 5 years, I would say.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:04:33}
Okay, alright.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:34}
Yeah, maybe that's why she stopped there. Mm-hmm.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:04:36}
Because all my jobs is longevity, so…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:39}
No problem. So what I will need that other job for, though, is your resume. Do you have a copy of your resume? Or do you need help creating it?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:04:45}
Nope, I have one on my phone.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:48}
Awesome. Do you need help reviewing it? Like, do you want me to edit it, or leave it as is?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:04:53}
Oh… Excuse me.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:57}
I guess…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:04:57}
I really need to update it.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:04:59}
I don't have…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:05:01}
The last place of employment that I have on my.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:05:04}
Uh, we…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:05:05}
The resume is Heidelberg's.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:05:08}
That's when I was here in Ohio.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:05:10}
And then when I was.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:05:11}
That's Ohio.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:05:11}
I went to North Carolina, I picked up a couple other jobs, and that… I never put them on it.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:05:16}
Okay, you didn't put the railroad Company or Mann and Hummel. Okay, so we'll add those two.
Right. Not a problem. Okay, great, so that we can discuss, um, next steps in terms of us going ahead and editing your resume, so that's good to know.
Great. Um… so we just finished that.
Now, the next part is your short-term and long-term goals, so I'm gonna read you what was written, and then if you're in agreement with it, I'll leave it as is, or if you want me to change anything, I will change it. Okay? Okay.
Alright, so the short-term goal that was written was, um, Anthony Klingman would like to obtain employment as a warehouse attendant or forklift operator within the next 3 to 18 months.
He aims to work 40 to 45 hours per week. He aspires to earn 20 per hour, and this is in alignment with the wage data in his area.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:06:17}
this.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:06:18}
Okay, perfect.
Mm-hmm.
I'm just gonna change the spelling of something here, one moment… This aligns… Okay.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:06:39}
Go ahead.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:06:47}
Okay, and then what was written as the way we here at America Works can support you is America Works of New York will support you, um, in the following ways. So we offer benefits counseling to help you understand the impacts of work on your Social Security benefits.
We're gonna help you with your resume, um, or any cover letters, if you want to submit those.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:07:12}
Mm-hmm. Absolutely.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:07:13}
Education assistance if you need it, um, and helping you, um, sending you job leads related to your goals, connecting you to different job opportunities, and offer any trainings that we have available at the moment.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:07:28}
Okay, that's… Yes, I need all that. Perfect, perfect, so that… Well, I got another… I got one quick question.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:07:36}
Yes, of course.
We do help with transportation, so… Okay. Um, let me explain two ways. So, when you get we can help you before getting employed if you can, um, show proof that you have an interview scheduled. We can help you, you know, by sending you a gas card to get to the job interview. That's one.
Number 2, uh, you get up to 12 Visa gas cards. You're entitled to 12.
Um, and your duration here, um, as long as you work 30 hours, and you provide your pay stubs.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:08:11}
Okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:08:12}
Okay, so yeah, we do assist. You would just have to send us that information. Yes. Right.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:08:16}
So, now, at this time, right now at this moment.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:08:20}
Uh.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:08:21}
No, I'm not driving.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:08:22}
I'm like, right, I'm actually…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:08:24}
I actually like using public transportation for the moment, because my car is down. And when we're being on the fixed income at the moment.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:08:32}
It's hard to get the work done on the.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:08:34}
car that I need to get done.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:08:36}
No, I won't have no more problems.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:08:37}
problems.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:08:38}
I see. I'm using public transportation.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:08:39}
meditation, or I get a ride.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:08:41}
ride. Okay. If you get the ride, you could still do the gas card, because you can help out whoever is giving you the ride.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:08:47}
Okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:08:48}
I'm imagining.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:08:49}
If I can get it right, how do I… how would I submit that information to y'all, so y'all know that, you know, this is what's going on, so it won't…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:08:58}
Like, I'm just getting.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:08:59}
The cards and, you know.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:09:01}
The only other thing is really… Great question. Yep, you would submit your pay stub to prove that you have been going to work, that you got paid for the 30 hours that you worked. Yep, that's the only proof you need to submit.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:09:13}
Okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:09:14}
So, that's not like a working.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:09:15}
30 hours?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:09:17}
Uh, no, no, that's the minimum required for you to get a transportation. No, no, yeah.
No, we want you to… the main goal of Ticket to Work is to have you be financially independent, and if you can work 40 hours or more, that'd be wonderful and fantastic. The minimum is 30, because some folks are unable to work the 40, so the minimum is 30.
Okay. Yeah.
Does that answer your question?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:09:43}
Mhm.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:09:44}
Oh, okay. And it's… oh, and it's still… is it…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:09:46}
is…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:09:47}
is due.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:09:48}
the ticket to work, because my sister did it, and I'm just…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:09:50}
I'll make sure that.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:09:51}
the same.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:09:52}
Is it still…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:09:53}
Where you get the first 9 months, uh.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:09:56}
Before y'all.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:09:57}
Actually start looking to see.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:10:00}
Welcome to Jim.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:10:00}
Until y'all start looking to see how much was made, how much I gotta give back.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:10:05}
Excellent question. Um, just remind me, are you on SSDI?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:10:09}
Yes, I am.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:10:10}
And that's correct. Yeah, and actually, hold on, before I answer that, um, within the last… they do look at your employment within the last 5 years to determine how many months you have left of your trial work period.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:10:24}
For the last 5 years.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:10:26}
Last five years, yeah. So, if I had any… then you're good as of… Yeah, because I haven't worked.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:10:31}
I haven't.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:10:32}
worked since 21.
Mm-hmm, that's to your good. Yep, so within the last… exactly. So, just have to say that, because some folks, you know, have worked within the last 5 years, and then they're like, but I thought I got my 9 months. It counts within the last 5 they're looking at. Oh, well, see, then I get to start.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:10:48}
I get to start from scratch.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:10:49}
Fresh. Yes, yes, it seemed, just based off of what you're, you know, stating and reporting, um, it sounds like you haven't used any of your months yet. Mm-hmm. Right. And as a reminder, the way that works is you get 9 months.
Um, in which you can work and earn as much as you can. You get to keep your Social Security check, as well as the money from work.
Um, for 9 months, then you have a transitional period. You get, um, 1 month of cessation. That's, you know, after the 9th, that 10th month is saying, okay, get ready to transition to the next phase of the program. You get 2 grace period months.
And then you, um, within those two months, you enter what is called the extended period of eligibility. That's when they start to monitor how much you're making before the benefit gets suspended.
Once you start earning after that $1,690 monthly gross, that's when the benefit would suspend.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:11:44}
Okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:11:45}
And by benefit, I mean cash payment.
Yeah, because you still get your other… there are other benefits, um, to the Ticket to Work program, such as if you have Medicare, you get that for 93 months consecutive, so that's untouched.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:11:59}
Okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:11:59}
you are also protected from medical reviews. That's untouched, see? So there are other benefits other than… the trial work, um, to the program. Mm-hmm. Does all that make sense so far? Yes, it does.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:12:11}
Oof.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:12:12}
Awesome, awesome. Okay, so we went over your short term.
Um, now long-term, she wrote, Anthony Klingman's long-term goal is to continue his career as forklift operator over the next 3 years.
Planning to continue to work 40 to 50 hours with a stable, reliable company.
Um, your projected wage is $30 an hour.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:12:36}
Mm-hmm.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:12:37}
Uh huh.
Which is in standard with… the truck and tractor operator in your region. Okay. Mm-hmm. Does that… Sound good? Do you agree with those long-term goals? Awesome.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:12:51}
Boom.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:12:52}
wonderful. Um, so the way we can help you there is continue to provide you with benefits counseling. Um, we can help you… once you get work, we help you keep the work, right? So we have ongoing meetings, so just check in, see how you're doing.
Um, if you're needing to request any accommodations at work, we could help with that.
Um, if you're needing, like I said, transportation, you mentioned you need assistance with that. Um, ongoing training, so any, um, connections to different networks or different, um, resources in your community, if you want me to look something up, I can help you with that, too.
People have asked me for all kinds of things. They're like, do you have resources for health? Do you have resources for mental health? Like, different things I… if I don't have it, then I can look it up and help you.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:13:40}
Right. Because, like, right now, I got my, uh, resume out on Indeed.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:13:45}
Right, so that's the first thing we gotta do. Yeah, I do get some respect.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:13:48}
appliances.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:13:50}
Mmm, oh, you do? Okay. When was the last time you got a response? That's good to hear.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:13:54}
Um…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:13:55}
Mhm.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:13:57}
Ooh… October?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:13:59}
But it didn't…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:14:01}
But, you know, I had interviewed and everything, but it didn't pan out, because, you know, they say, well, we'll get back in touch with you, we, you know.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:14:08}
I go, you know, will I.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:14:09}
hear from you. Either way, they was like, yeah, sure, and I ain't heard nonsense.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:14:12}
Oh, man, yeah, yeah, I've been hearing that. Um, I was hearing that a lot at the end of last year.
Um, so I'm hoping this year's a little better, so you're not alone in that.
I don't want you to feel alone. It's been rough. But the good news, I've been hearing some of my other clients, slowly but surely, people are getting hired. So, cheers, good luck, hopefully. I'll be here to assist in the process, I'll send you job leads, so we're gonna be a partnership. You're gonna be applying to jobs, I'm going to be sending you jobs to apply to based off of what you told me, and then you keep me posted, and I got an interview.
Let's say you submit, um, a resume to a company, and you want me to call them to find out the status, I can do that.
If you need help interviewing, I can help you with that. Sending you resources like that to make sure that you're ready for your interview.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:15:01}
Mm-hmm, yes. Okay, great.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:15:05}
Alright, so the next part here, we're going to talk about supports, just like we have been. I talked about benefits counseling with you, goal setting. The goals change as you change, right? So, you can start one way, but if you're like, Ana, I want to do something else, just keep me posted and I will change your goals in the system.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:15:24}
Okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:15:25}
Mm-hmm. The resume is also an ongoing document. We'll work on it now, but if we need to change it in a few months, we can certainly do that.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:15:33}
Okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:15:34}
Yep, and for training, I will send you… I usually send any kind of trainings that are sent my way that the company's offering virtually.
since I'm in New York, it'll be virtual trainings. Um, I'll send over what I'm sent. So, I tend to send a lot of emails, so please check your email, um, if you can once a day, just to see what, you know, if I've sent anything, or if you can't every day, every other day, but just as long as you're consistent in checking your emails, just in case we sent something.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:16:01}
Okay, now, uh, with the email.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:16:04}
Mm-hmm, my concern.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:16:05}
What's your email?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:16:06}
what email.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:16:06}
What address of mine do you have?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:16:09}
Okay, let's review that. Good question. Let me go back to your document.
Let me go over all your ticket holder information. Let me make sure we have everything for you. Um, I have AnthonyKlingman at yahoo.com. Perfect. Great. And then the address I have is 3559 Reading Road.
Mm-hmm. Cincinnati, Ohio. Yep.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:16:34}
They'll hire 4529.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:16:36}
Perfect. And the date of birth I have is… oh, it's your birthday month, on January 23rd. Yes, happy early birthday.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:16:43}
Thank you, too.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:16:43}
Days after my mother.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:16:44}
was in 5…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:16:45}
Yeah, probably before my father's. So I'm a late birthday present.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:16:49}
In the early work, they wrote it.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:16:50}
Oh, I love that, I love that. Yay! Okay, I'm gonna make a note of your birthday, that's wonderful.
Oh, good to know. Any, any plans this year for your birthday?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:17:02}
No, not really.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:17:03}
I just want to see it. I just want to see it.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:17:06}
You know what I mean?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:17:07}
Now that I've got.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:17:08}
Old.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:17:09}
Mm-hmm. You know.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:17:09}
So, it's, it's like, it's another.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:17:11}
And, I mean.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:17:13}
Don't get me wrong, I'm glad to see it come, I'm glad to see it go.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:17:16}
I've been here for you.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:17:17}
You know, I made it a year.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:17:18}
So, you know, I just want to see it. Yeah, yeah. I like that. Take it one day at a time. Be grateful for every day, absolutely. You never know.
Yup, yup, grateful to be here. Mm-hmm.
Very good, okay, so we went over your supports… Job placement, um, I'm gonna send you some resources. Uh, do you… have you ever checked your state's, um.
Career One Stop Job Bank, like, they have a bunch of… like, anytime a job is available, they'll kind of dump it in there, and you can kind of periodically check to see what jobs are available in your area.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:17:56}
What, uh, website is that?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:17:58}
I'll send it to you, don't worry about it, but it's called the Career One Stop. Mm-hmm. Okay. I'll make a note to send you that. Career One Stop. What I'll do is I'll send it to you with your zip code, like, with what jobs are within 5 miles of your zip code, and we can start there. Yeah.
So, that's in addition to Indeed, because Indeed, you know, there might be opportunities on there, but sometimes they're not always real, or they're not updated, so… Well, I mean…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:18:24}
I got, like, alone.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:18:26}
Indeed.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:18:26}
Lincolnton.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:18:28}
Mm-hmm, good.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:18:31}
There's another one, um, I can't even.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:18:33}
Being the name of it.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:18:34}
But the other one that I'm on, they send me jobs for, like…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:18:38}
recruiter? Mm-hmm.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:18:39}
I can't remember, it's like, this image out to, like, West Virginia, uh, you know, places out, like, there.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:18:45}
So, I got…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:18:46}
a job offer for a forklift operator in Houston, Texas.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:18:51}
And it's like…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:18:52}
Okay, y'all want me to come and work for you, but are y'all gonna.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:18:55}
helped me.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:18:56}
with my relocation.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:18:58}
Right, right. You know what I mean?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:19:00}
a decimal.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:00}
big move.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:19:01}
You know, it's.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:02}
I mean, I understand you're gonna.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:19:03}
You're trying to pay me the money.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:05}
survive.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:19:05}
But…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:06}
Mm-hmm.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:19:07}
Still gotta spend money to get to you.
Exactly. You know, so, you know, but… I mean, I haven't had offers like that, but, you know, I turned them down because, you know, you only.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:16}
I won't seen it one week.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:19:17}
Anyway, if you.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:18}
We get down here.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:19:19}
we could put you to work.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:21}
Gotta get down.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:19:21}
I gotta find a place to stay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:23}
For all of this, I'm not.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:19:24}
And y'all not trying to help me do nothin.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:26}
That's over.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:19:26}
Whoa.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:27}
it's a no, it's not a good fit. Right. Yeah, I hear you on that.
Exactly. We want someone that's gonna work with you, um, hopefully closer to home, you know? But that's another question I have for you. How far out are you willing to look? So when I'm doing job searches for you, um, how many miles from home?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:19:52}
There's really, um… I really don't have a certain.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:56}
new mouths become.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:19:57}
cause.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:19:58}
Um, I knew.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:19:59}
I used to work in Kentucky. I used to work.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:20:00}
Florence, Kentucky. And…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:20:02}
of… At one point, I wasn't driving, and I took the city bus.
my home to, uh, Kentucky every day.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:20:12}
To and fro.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:20:13}
So…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:20:14}
Hmm.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:20:15}
And that was, like… I don't know how many miles it was, but I.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:20:18}
every day, y'.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:20:19}
I was on time, you know.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:20:21}
Okay. How far was it? How long did it take you to get to work?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:20:26}
Mmm…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:20:28}
45 minutes.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:20:29}
Perfect.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:20:30}
Okay, that's not too bad.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:20:32}
catching, uh.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:20:33}
A bus…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:20:34}
In Cincinnati, and then I.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:20:36}
I'll call another.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:20:36}
bus from Cincinnati to Kentucky.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:20:38}
Uh, to form.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:20:39}
So, it was, you know, like I said, about 45 minutes.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:20:43}
You know, it wasn't, you know.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:20:44}
really bad or anything like that, but, you know, it was just… I was able to do it, you know? I mean, it didn't last a whole, you know, that long of a time, because once I got to working, you know.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:20:54}
I was able to…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:20:55}
get the money together that I needed to get.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:20:58}
transportation together. Right, right.
Okay, sounds like you made it work.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:21:04}
Oh, yeah.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:21:05}
Especially if it's something.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:21:06}
Something that I like doing, you know?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:21:08}
So, if…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:21:09}
It's something that I, you know, enjoy doing.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:21:11}
I don't have no problem.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:21:12}
Finding a way to and.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:21:13}
from whereby now.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:21:14}
to go.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:21:15}
Right.
it motivates you to want to, you know, get there on time and do what you need to do. I hear you. Mm-hmm.
Okay.
That is good. I'm glad to hear that. So it sounds like you are pretty flexible to how far out you're willing to go, as long, like you said, that you like the job and you enjoy it.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:21:35}
Right.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:21:36}
Okay. I will make a note of that.
you know, different people have different thresholds. They're like, nope, don't get me anything more than 5 miles of my house, 10 miles of my house, so that's very good to know. I'll start closer, you know, but if I can't find anything.
I now know that I could stretch it a little bit.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:21:52}
And then, you know, as you go on and you send me things, I'll let you know if.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:21:57}
You know, that's like…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:21:57}
Out of my comfort.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:21:58}
Or something like that. And, you know, that way.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:22:01}
As long as we, you know, communicate that way, then it shouldn't be a problem.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:22:06}
I agree, and I'm glad that you mentioned that communication piece, because that's actually one of the most important things of the program, is honest, two-way communication, right? Like, if I know what's going… the more I know what's going on, the more I can help you. You know, of course, whatever you're comfortable with sharing, um, related to your work. So, um, yeah, if I don't know something, or if there's a way I can help but I'm not told, then
how can I help, right? Right. Yeah, so communication is key. I'm a big communicator. You'll see that I email a lot.
I call at least once a month just to check in. To be in compliance, we actually have to speak twice, uh, once, but we're not limited to once. I have clients calling me, some of them daily, others weekly, others every two. It really depends on your need and your level of independence.
You know, there's some folks that need a little more support, and that's okay.
So, we'll find a rhythm, we'll see what works. Some people are like, just let me do my thing, I'll check in with you in a month. And I'm like, that's fine. As long as we speak, I'm okay with that. The program is voluntary, right? So, if at any point you're like, yeah, this is not for me, this is not working out, that's okay. It is up to you. This is for you, right?
You just let me know.
Um, or if we see that we're not meeting goals, we change them, we adjust it. Or if we see, okay, can't help you, maybe there's another agency that could help better. So we just keep the lines of communication open throughout the entire process.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:23:30}
Alright, that's not a problem.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:23:31}
Yeah, awesome, awesome. Okay, great, and I'm happy these were already in here, so I cut our time a little bit. I still have a few more things to review. Um, I'm just gonna put in a summary of everything we talked about, and I'm gonna email it to you, okay?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:23:47}
Okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:23:48}
Yep, so I'm just gonna go ahead and work on this for just a few minutes. You'll hear some silence for me to finish up your document, okay?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:23:56}
Okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:23:57}
Okay, great. And if you have any questions while I'm typing, please feel free to let me know.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:24:02}
Alright, I sure will.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:24:03}
Thank you.
Yeah, I'm almost done. Thank you for your patience.
Hello?
Uh, hello, Mr. Klingman?
Hello?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:28:25}
Yes, I'm here.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:28:26}
Sorry, I thought we got disconnected. Sorry about that. No, I'm here. Okay, great. Um, so I just finished your document. I'm gonna go ahead and send you a copy to your email through DocuSign. Have you ever used DocuSign before?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:28:41}
Yes, I have.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:28:43}
Okay, perfect. So I'm sending that over now.
Then you'll sign the document, I'll sign it, and then you'll be officially in the Ticket to Work program.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:28:55}
Okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:28:56}
How long is…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:28:57}
How long is the program itself?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:28:59}
Good question.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:29:01}
admitted, you know.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:29:02}
How long does it last?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:29:03}
I mean, does it just…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:29:04}
less, like.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:29:05}
9 months, or…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:29:06}
Mm-hmm. On goal.
That's a great question. So it lasts, um… longer than the trial work period, for sure. So we're here at every stage of the program. The program in its totality is about 5 years long, right? So you get the 9-month trial work period, then you have the extended period of eligibility, right? So once you best case scenario, you start working, you're earning above level, um, Social Security's monitoring that, right? God forbid, I forgot to mention, God forbid something happens after, let's say you start working above the level and your payments stop.
You have the protection, right, for 36 months, of knowing that if you lose that job, your benefit can be turned back on. You get access to expedited reinstatement, and you do not have to, um… open a new case. You don't have to open a new account with Social Security, they just, um, you provide proof to them that… of what happened. Did you lose your job? Did you leave? Did you go on? You know, you would just let them know, and they'll turn your benefit back on.
Okay. So that's a good protection there. So the program is officially done once you've met what is called all your milestones. You've been working for a period of time, consistently.
off the benefit, everything is stable, and once you can prove to Social Security, yes, I am, um, independent of my benefits, like, I'm… I'm good.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:30:23}
Mhm.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:30:24}
Mm-hmm. Yep, so that's how it would work.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:30:28}
Lord.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:30:28}
Mhm.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:30:31}
No, that's really… that's all I had to… I had to thought about that, and I was wanting to make sure.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:30:35}
that I…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:30:36}
new, you know.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:30:37}
how long…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:30:38}
was the period.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:30:40}
Yes. As far as to get the work.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:30:41}
I mean, I understand about animals.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:30:43}
in the extended.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:30:43}
Yeah, we're here for sure. I want to know, like, is it just… you just work… let's say you just work a year, you know?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:30:52}
Mm-hmm.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:30:53}
It's only good for a year, so after that year, y'all go away.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:30:56}
No, we don't.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:30:57}
Okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:30:58}
No, no, no, not at all. We're here for, um, that's called ongoing employment support, because, you know, you might still need support while you're there at work. Whether it be accommodations, whether it might be, I just need advice on a situation at work, you know, we're here for you for that.
That's why we have our monthly check-ins, yeah. It could be all kinds of things, like, you need to report an incident that happened at work, and you don't know how to do it. We can set up a time and do that.
Yeah, we're here for you. Mm-hmm. Okay.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:31:24}
That works for me. Awesome, awesome. Um, let's see…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:31:34}
I just emailed you, so hopefully you got it to the email that we confirmed earlier.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:31:39}
Right.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:31:40}
Mm-hmm.
While you do that, I'll just review the goals of the program. We've already actually gone over all of this, but I just have to read it to you like every other client, just to check in, okay? So, your participation in the program is voluntary, as we mentioned earlier.
Um, it's important you understand the program's goals before deciding if it's right for you.
Um, the purpose of the Ticket to Work is to offer you the support you need to increase both your ability to work, your earnings, and reduce reliance on Social Security disability benefits.
Um, by agreeing to assign your ticket and participate in the program, you're agreeing to make a steady effort to achieve these goals.
Our role at AmeriCorps Works is to do all we can to help you replace your benefits and payments with earnings from work to the extent possible. You will not, and this is important, be penalized if you cannot become fully self-supporting.
Try your best. It's okay.
Mhm.
The Ticket to Work program is not always a good fit for every disability beneficiary, but if you are committed to working, we are here to provide the services and supports to help you do so.
Um, you can start out, and this part isn't too relevant, but I'll still read it, because you mentioned you wanted to do 40 hours, but you can start out working, if you wanted to, part-time hours, um, but with the goal of becoming self-supporting in time.
Um, so there's some individuals that are like, I could only do 30 right now, okay. So with that client, we would try to work towards 40, if possible. Again, you're not penalized if you can't, you know, everyone's situation's different.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:33:18}
And lastly, um, we should let you know that we do not advise or condone the practice of artificially manipulating a ticket holder's work or earnings to remain on Social Security.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:33:29}
That is the last portion. And I do see, I think you did receive… my document.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:33:37}
I'm looking at it now while I'm talking.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:33:39}
Perfect, yup, take your time, no rush, read through it, make sure everything looks good.
And then I…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:33:47}
Look at it before I sign anything.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:33:49}
No, absolutely. I'm the same way. Mm-hmm. That's why I read the goals, too, before anybody signs, because, you know, at any point, you could be like, oh, wait, I'm not in agreement with that. I've had people be like, but I don't want to get off my benefit, and I'm like, wait a minute, not for you, then. Not for you.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:34:06}
Is it only one place I need to sign? I mean, I see my name on just about every section.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:34:11}
Yeah, you have to sign in, um, different sections, acknowledging different parts of the document.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:34:17}
No, right?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:34:18}
Mm-hmm. So the first thing, you'll create a digital signature. Yeah, and then it'll, like, take that, and then you can copy it in different parts of the document.
And this document is changeable, so if you're like, if this… this is what I meant when we change your goals, we can always edit this and resubmit it, re-sign it.
Um, so this is yours to adjust as often as you need to.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:34:44}
I'm sitting…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:34:45}
Send it back to you now. Okay, perfect.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:34:48}
I done DocuSign before.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:34:50}
All my signature, my.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:34:51}
Signature is already in there.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:34:53}
All I had to do was just fine.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:34:55}
And it just goes.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:34:55}
story.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:34:56}
Only thing I had to do was, the initial part, I had to.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:34:58}
Put that back in there.
Oh, okay. Perfect, perfect.
Alright, now I'm gonna review as well.
Then after I review and sign, I'll send you your welcome email, because after that, then there's another set of documents that I would need from you, um, and you can get them to me between now and next week, that's fine, when you can. So, for example, one being your Social Security award letter. Do you have access to that?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:35:25}
That's on my phone, too.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:35:26}
Perfect. I don't… I do paper…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:35:29}
Do paperless everything.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:35:30}
as everything, there you go. With the times, funer with the times, I love it. But see, I knew that just on the trip.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:35:37}
that nowadays, everybody has a cell phone.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:35:41}
and…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:35:42}
Since my cell phone, I always got my phone with me, it's easier for me to put, like, my resume, my.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:35:48}
war letter, all of that.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:35:49}
That is in my phone, and, you know.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:35:52}
picture of my identity.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:35:52}
vacation.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:35:53}
I need that, too. Perfect. Okay, I got a picture of my identity. Yeah, I got a picture of my identity.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:35:58}
notification, my social security card.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:36:00}
birth certificate.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:36:01}
Everything is in my phone. So, just like what you're saying, you know, I need to sign this, I need to hire this paperwork and that paperwork.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:36:07}
paperwork, and that's.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:36:08}
All y'all gonna do is make a copy of it, even if I bring the hard copy in.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:36:12}
Y'all just gonna make a copy.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:36:13}
of it and give it back to me, so if I got.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:36:15}
On my phone, here you go.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:36:16}
I can just email it to you.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:36:18}
That's perfect. That's exactly it. Yup, you're ahead of me. Yup, exactly. Your resume, your award letter, your ID, and then the last document, it's a little trickier, it'll be in the email, the welcome email, as, like, a reminder for both of us. It's called a Benefits Planning Query.
it's in it, so you don't have to work… remember to remember right now. It is a document that… reviews what benefits you have through Social Security, and if you have used any of your trial work months, that document will tell you.
You've used X amount of trial work months, it'll tell you.
Or if you're on Medicare, it'll say that. It'll review all your benefits. So that's a benefits plan inquiry, and we do also request that so we can set you up before you start working with a benefits counselor. So that way, they can advise you before you start working, and letting you know how working will affect all of your benefits.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:37:11}
Okay?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:37:12}
Yeah, Medicaid.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:37:13}
Medicare.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:37:14}
There you go. And Medicare, you… your insurance is protected, you don't have to worry about that, but the benefits counseling will go over that further, more detail. Okay. Mm-hmm.
Okay, so now that you signed that… I have to add you officially to the Ticket to Work portal, okay? And so that you can only have your ticket assigned to one agency at a time.
Right, so last time, I think you spoke to Adrienne, you were with Allsup, and then, you know, we had started your intake, but weren't able to continue working with you, but this time we're in the clear.
It looks like you were de-assigned from them, and now you could be assigned to us.
Now I'm gonna go ahead and… put you in the system, officially. You will also get a letter from Social Security saying that you chose AmeriCorks as your ticket to work, um, employment network.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:38:13}
Alright.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:38:14}
Mhm.
Alright, I'm putting… I just want to make sure to do everything with you on the phone, so we don't have many things pending.
And then we can get right to your resume. That's the next step.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:38:27}
Alright.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:38:28}
Mhm.
Okay, first name, last name… Anthony Klingman. Do you have a middle initial, Anthony?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:38:37}
Jake.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:38:38}
Okay. And I'm also a junior.
Junior, okay, gotcha. Is that how it shows on your Social Security card?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:38:44}
It comes up.
Anthony Geron Klingman's your only guest.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:38:51}
Okay, my initial.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:38:52}
This is AJCJ.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:38:54}
Daisy Jake, gotcha.
JCJ… Okay, you've been successfully enrolled in the portal.
Now I'm going to enroll you in our system.
I'm gonna add you to my email list, so that email list is I… when there's trainings, I send them out. I'll be looking out for the OSHA for you. They offer it virtually, so how it typically works is, when they have the OSHA trainings, it's, um… three Thursdays in a row, or that's how I was last time, 3 Thursdays in a row, three classes, you do 1 hour, and then at the end, you'll do… you'll do mini assignments, like my… and then at the end, you'll have an assignment, and then you'll get your OSHA card.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:39:44}
Okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:39:45}
Mm-hmm, if you successfully, um, do the class.
Typically, it's not more than 3 sessions. I don't see it for January, but I'll keep on the lookout, sometimes I'll add it.
like, midway through the month, but if they don't have it this month, um, they might have it next month. So as soon as I see that, I have a few people pending that I need to send that to. So, in your file, I'll put OSHA training.
Um, forklift… Oh, that's… is there anything else that you want, um, assistance with at this time? Nope, I don't.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:40:20}
do it.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:40:21}
Let me know a whole lot.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:40:22}
Yeah, I know I gotta go in, and I have.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:40:24}
The paperwork, do you…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:40:25}
By the middle of next week.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:40:27}
Beautiful, and I'll send you that welcome email as a reminder, so it'll be everything we discussed. And then lastly, I'm going to just… finish your profile, because it switches it on our screen. So, I have your birthday, um, could you confirm your race and ethnicity for me?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:40:44}
Um, Black African American.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:40:47}
Mm-hmm, gotcha. Hispanic or non-Hispanic?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:40:50}
That's great.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:40:54}
Okay… Gotcha. Do you live in a private home?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:40:59}
Uh, apartment.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:41:01}
environment.
Okay, what's your marital status?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:41:10}

[Ana Arvelo] {00:41:11}
Okay… Gotcha. Are you a veteran?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:41:15}
Nope.
Phew, okay.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:41:18}
Do you know a second language?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:41:20}
Nope.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:41:22}
Um, what's your highest level of education?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:41:25}
Some callers, no debrief.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:41:26}
Some college, okay? Mm-hmm. Not a veteran. Do you have your driver's license?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:41:33}
Yes.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:41:35}
Yes.
Ooh, okay… Alright… Perfect.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, now I'm gonna send you your welcome email.
And the welcome email will also have… the Working While Disabled pamphlet that goes over all the stages of the program as well.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:42:13}
Hold on.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:42:14}
Mm-hmm, so it gives you something to read and review.
And you can always call us and ask more questions, too, about the program.
Mm-hmm.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:42:27}
Not a problem.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:42:29}
Yeah.
You mentioned that you worked with staffing agencies near you, right?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:42:44}
Yes.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:42:45}
Yeah, okay. Um… Are you open to working with other staffing agencies, or… No. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Okay.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:42:55}
I mean, for a lot of places.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:42:57}
like, when I worked.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:42:57}
the train, that's how I got on there.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:43:01}
Gotcha. Okay, so I'm gonna look up, uh, different company staffing agencies to send you, um, hopefully, just so we have more of a chance. Like, I'm gonna be sending you my own job leads that I see out there in the world, in different job boards, but I'll also send you staffing agencies.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:43:17}
Alright. Mm-hmm. Just so you have a…

[Ana Arvelo] {00:43:21}
better chance.
of finding something. Multiple avenues.
Okay.
Okay… So you're going to get this email, it's called Welcome to America Works.
of the Ticket to Work program.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:43:37}
So that should be there shortly.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:43:40}
And then, yep, send me your resume.
Along with everything else, like you said you would. And then we can do a touch base session.
Cuz, um, we gotta add the new stuff to your resume.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:43:53}
Right. Yeah, so let's look at my calendar, and we'll schedule our next meeting to do that.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:44:00}
Alright, what's your next week look like?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:44:03}
Would you say, next week?

[Ana Arvelo] {00:44:05}
Mm-hmm.
Or the week after that, whatever works for you.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:44:09}
I'm open either the week.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:44:10}

Let's do…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:44:18}
As long as it's not the 23rd.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:44:20}
Okay, you got it.
We can do Tuesday… next Tuesday? That's okay? Okay. Alright. Well, that's what I, uh…

[(513) 432-8268] {00:44:33}
Original, um… Pole call was for.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:44:38}
It was. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Yeah, exactly, so technically, we'll just keep our appointment that we had there. I'll just put it back on, but I'll rename it Resume Preparation.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:44:48}
Oh, got it. And that one should be good, so that way we can get you set up.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:44:54}
Um… should we do 11?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:44:58}
the plan.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:44:59}
Okay.
Perfect, and if you need to change the appointment for whatever reason, just give me a heads up as soon as you know you will not be able to attend.
Um, or if I need to change it, I'll call you.
Um, but for now, we're all set.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, so I just added you to the calendar.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:45:24}
Right.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:45:25}
Alright, do you have any other questions, comments, concerns, anything for me before I let you go?

[(513) 432-8268] {00:45:31}
I don't.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:45:32}
Okay, awesome. Alright, so I look forward to working together, and if you need anything between now and Tuesday, please feel free to call me.

[(513) 432-8268] {00:45:39}
I'm like, thank you.

[Ana Arvelo] {00:45:40}
You're welcome, Anthony. Take care, have a good weekend.

You too. Bye.

[Squeak Stone] {00:00:01}
Good morning, Cliff, how are you?

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:00:04}
frustrated with Nick Hill.

[Squeak Stone] {00:00:06}
Pardon?

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:00:08}
I'm frustrated with that, uh, woman that you signed me up, uh, that is… Yeah. Just frustrated with her. She's trying to screw up my resume. I never worked for Home Depot in my entire life.

[Squeak Stone] {00:00:21}
Okay.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:00:22}
She's, uh, adding years onto Key Food. I didn't stop working for Key Food last year.

[Squeak Stone] {00:00:28}
Right, right. Yeah, I wrote… did you see what she wrote back? And I'm… I'm really… I'm gonna actually kind of report her, because that's…

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:00:36}
I'm deleting her, uh, from my phone, I'm blocking… I'm gonna block her from my phone.

[Squeak Stone] {00:00:41}
Yeah, yeah.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:00:42}
Uh, delete her email. I mean, she screwed up everything on my resume. I'm keeping your resume… Please. …intact in my phone, but I'm not dealing with her.

[Squeak Stone] {00:00:51}
No, I agree.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:00:53}
Yeah, no, he sounds great.
Yeah, he's out of Woodside. Uh, he calls me back, uh, he texts, and when I send him information on job interviews that I had scheduled for Joe Boothie, he… he's on top of it.

[Squeak Stone] {00:01:08}
Right, right.
Yeah, no, it was really interesting. She wrote back and she said, I didn't change anything, I just changed… and I'm like, no, you… she said that she added… You know, you can't add a job experience.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:01:23}
I can't add a job experience and then… then rearrange the years I worked for the other job.
You can't do that. No.
Because that shows me off.

[Squeak Stone] {00:01:33}
Yep, yep. She does say that you have… An interview with Morton Williams? I don't know what that is. No, no.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:01:42}
I told her that Morton Williams was hiring again for cash sharing. I went there a couple months ago, a month ago.

[Squeak Stone] {00:01:51}
Uh huh.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:01:52}
Uh, but he never hired me as a cashier. Now he's hiring for more cashier people again. I said that he has another job in, um… He has the site up on Indeed.
I didn't say I had to interview with him.
I never said I had any… I said that he was advertising on Indeed for another cashiering job. Why wasn't I hired before?
Yeah, because she said that…

[Squeak Stone] {00:02:22}
You must arrive between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. only on Wednesday, you know? Yeah. Okay, good. No, I was just so frustrated.
she says, I extended the dates of employment to show longevity, but you can't invent things like that. And I added the Home Depot to strengthen… so, actually, she's calling me, and I'm just… I'm not gonna take it. She's calling right now.
But I'm… that is unethical and ridiculous.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:02:53}
I told her that she screwed up my entire resume. I mean, she goes, it was a draft, Cliff. It wasn't your… your resume's still intact. I said, yeah, I know my resume's still… because Squeak did it.

[Squeak Stone] {00:03:03}
Right.
Yeah, because I thought, oh, that's really interesting. I know we were talking about Home Depot, but he never told me he worked there, and I thought, well, maybe I missed something. Okay, no, this is…

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:03:14}
They're at all.

[Squeak Stone] {00:03:16}
Yeah, no, that is really not… Not okay.
Very not okay. Well, I'm actually gonna talk to my supervisor about that, because she can't be… she cannot be inventing histories for people.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:03:32}
That's not okay.

[Squeak Stone] {00:03:34}
And she put typos in there as well? There was, you know, typos in there.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:03:40}
I just sent it to my trash. I'm gonna do… I'm gonna empty it in a minute. But, um…

[Squeak Stone] {00:03:46}
And it's not application tracking system friendly. I mean, you put that in there, and it's not going to be able to track.
It really isn't.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:03:55}
She's exten… I never worked those many years.

[Squeak Stone] {00:03:58}
Nope, nope, yep.
Yep, no issues.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:04:01}
Yeah.

[Squeak Stone] {00:04:02}
I haven't memorized in my head, I know. Yeah, you don't want to lie on a resume.
No, it's Yeah.
So…

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:04:11}
What he's trying to get me to do is lie, and I don't lie anymore.

[Squeak Stone] {00:04:14}
Nope, nope, yep, I 100% agree with you.
Um, so good. No, but I'm definitely gonna talk to… my supervisor about it. She's not really under me. Actually, I'll talk to her supervisor about it.
Who is her supervisor? I'm not exactly sure. I'm gonna… I'm gonna find out, because that's just unethical behavior.
Absolutely unethical. So, but yeah, stick with mine, you know, that's the best one to do. And, um, yeah, no, I'm excited to hear about… no, so what happened? Did you apply to the… so, the stop and shop, they called you back for an interview?

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:04:54}
Yeah, they called me back, uh, they called me back yesterday, asked me if I could come in Monday afternoon at 1 o'clock. I said.

[Squeak Stone] {00:04:59}
originally, I had.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:05:00}
interview, they said, okay, thank you very much. And I said, hold, hold, hold on. In my brain, I kicked in overdrive. I said, I'll be there at 1 o'clock, I'll rearrange the other interview.

[Squeak Stone] {00:05:13}
vegetable.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:05:13}
Anyway, more likely I'll be canceled on that Trafalty anyway.

[Squeak Stone] {00:05:16}
Yeah, they have the weirdest interview practices I have ever seen in my life.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:05:23}
It's an avatar. Before, you used to just go in… you would call them, and they would schedule you an interview.

[Squeak Stone] {00:05:31}
We're going through this mission.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:05:32}
AI thingamajig, which I can't stand, and it just… it cancels on you.

[Squeak Stone] {00:05:37}
Yeah, no, that's ridiculous.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:05:40}
So, with Stop and Shop… she called me, I said, I'll be there at 1 o'clock. I said, don't be surprised if I show up early. I'm always early, because you never know by the trains here in the subway.

[Squeak Stone] {00:05:52}
It hasn't changed.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:05:52}
Sometimes there might be a delay or something, so I said, don't be surprised, but I show up early, because it's just my nature.
I always show up maybe 15, 20 minutes early.

[Squeak Stone] {00:06:03}
That's perfect.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:06:05}
I'm a fast walker, number one.

[Squeak Stone] {00:06:07}
You…

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:06:08}
you can… I'm taking one train, but I'm transferring two other trains, and you never.

[Squeak Stone] {00:06:13}
know what could be the problem. Yeah, absolutely. No, that's really good practice. Really, really good practice. No, that's great. Oh, and also, thank you…

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:06:22}
I've learned that…

[Squeak Stone] {00:06:23}
I'm a father.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:06:24}
I mean, my father, uh, said, you always want to be early, you never want to be on time, you never want to be late, always early. Yeah.

[Squeak Stone] {00:06:31}
My, my, my husband says to be early is to be late. No, to be on time is to be late. You know, and… Yeah. You know, I mean, sometimes he, he exacerbates me, he gets me really, like, we end up at the airport, like, 6 hours before a flight, you know, but he doesn't want…

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:06:49}
TSA.

[Squeak Stone] {00:06:51}
Yep, you don't… you never know, you know, but it's like, okay, well, we can sit and people watch for a while.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:06:56}
And now you have to have the real ID.

[Squeak Stone] {00:06:59}
to show.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:07:00}
At the airport, so that even delays it sometimes more.

[Squeak Stone] {00:07:03}
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But thank you so much also for the photo. I really, really enjoyed seeing you. That was great. That was really, really lovely.
Um… You're locking.
Yeah, so…

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:07:17}
That's a transformation in his own style.

[Squeak Stone] {00:07:20}
That's amazing. Absolutely amazing.
Yeah. That was the guest.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:07:26}
That was the gastric ruin wide bypass surgery I had done.

[Squeak Stone] {00:07:30}
Really?

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:07:31}
Yeah, I got 90% of my body weight removed.

[Squeak Stone] {00:07:35}
Wow! That is amazing.
Wow. How does it feel?

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:07:41}
Well, I gained some of the weight back, but I'm not hitting 200, I'm about… I'm actually losing weight again, but naturally, because I can't go through the surgery again. But, uh, when I lost the weight, my friends were saying to Cliff, stop losing weight, you're making us look bad.

[Squeak Stone] {00:08:01}
Wow, good. Terrific. Well, and have you been practicing the interview questions so you don't get caught up again?

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:08:08}
Yeah, I'm practicing, especially I'm gonna have Stop and Shop, um… I'm gonna have… I'm gonna… I'm doing it, uh… After I get off the phone with you, and I'm gonna do it again, probably over the weekend.

[Squeak Stone] {00:08:19}
Okay. Before Monday.
Good, good, good. I think you're going to do great, you know, and especially since you've worked with them in the past, and you worked with them the longest. You were there for about 3 years, and that says a lot, you know, so… and you've got that cashier experience, they could see that?

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:08:36}
I mean, the resume that they have is an old resume, so that's kind of what they're looking at, and that… they don't have the updated resume from you.

[Squeak Stone] {00:08:44}
So I'm gonna bring the resident… Yeah, do that, bring that with.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:08:48}
Yeah, I'm gonna bring that with me.

[Squeak Stone] {00:08:51}
Perfect.
Perfect. Okay, well, keep me posted on that.
Um, did you have a nice… did you have a nice New Year?

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:08:59}
I stayed home, watched, uh, Rockin' Eve on my phone, uh, through YouTube.

[Squeak Stone] {00:09:05}
Nice. Uh, so I stayed…

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:09:07}
I stayed home in my room. Uh, the landlord and her daughter went to see family up at PA.
They haven't come back yet, so I got to play too much belt.

[Squeak Stone] {00:09:17}
Oh, nice!
Nice, nice, nice. Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, I did absolutely really nothing on New Year's Eve. Um, my son is actually in… Poland visiting right now, a friend of his.
So, at about 6 p.m. my time, he called, because it was midnight there, and he was all happy to wish me a Happy New Year, and that just, like, made me so happy, you know, that he's someplace had actually thought about me, you know, it's like, aww! Um, so that was probably the best part of the new year, and then, um, yeah, I just…
you know, just sat and talked to my husband, and that was it. It was nice and quiet, I liked it.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:09:54}
Yeah, my…

[Squeak Stone] {00:09:55}
My aunt, my…

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:09:56}
My uncle, he didn't do much. He said he had dinner with his wife and, uh, his in-laws and celebrated New Year's that way.

[Squeak Stone] {00:10:03}
Yeah, yeah, no, it was really… it's nice… I think it's nice to have a choir. And then yesterday, see, I live out in… Sort of a very… Um… more rural area, and, you know, took a long hike in the woods yesterday, and that was just… it was just beautiful. A lot of… we have snow. I don't know, do you have snow at all in the Bronx right now?

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:10:26}
We had, uh, Snow Scroll at the midnight on New Year's.

[Squeak Stone] {00:10:30}
disease, which…

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:10:31}
Which hurt the, uh, city to clean up all the confetti?

[Squeak Stone] {00:10:35}
Oh, wow, yeah.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:10:37}
Uh, but, um… The snowstorm that didn't hit us, we only got maybe 3 inches, and it cleared up on the next day.

[Squeak Stone] {00:10:49}
Oh, okay.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:10:50}
It turned to rain the next day, so it would fill the snow away.

[Squeak Stone] {00:10:54}
Uh-huh.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:10:56}
It rarely gets snow, it hits mostly the rooftops.

[Squeak Stone] {00:10:59}
Mhm, mhm.
Yeah, well, we got a little bit, you know, we probably have 4 inches at the most, so it's not a ton here, but it looks… it looks pretty, I like it.
You know, I really like the way it looked, because otherwise it's just dirt, you know, and dead trees, so I kind of like it. It brings it… and also when the light hits it, it makes it a lot brighter, so… Don't you have the animals, though?

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:11:22}
this?

[Squeak Stone] {00:11:23}
In the woods? Or what kind of animals?
Yeah, yeah, I mean, but they're, they're sleeping.
You know, it's… Yeah, they're not… you know, I mean, right now, I mean, they do come out maybe at night sometimes, but, you know, on all the ski resorts, I mean, there's, like.
that's where they live, it's up in the hills, in the mountains. Um, and in the springtime, in summer, I mean, there's nobody there, and they're awake, and then in the wintertime, they're kind of sleeping, and everybody's there, so…

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:11:56}
Not where I was when I was living in Hudson.

[Squeak Stone] {00:11:59}
Yeah, yeah.
Probably, yeah. Well, listen, good luck with your interview. Keep me posted. If you need anything from me, um, let me know, okay?

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:12:10}
Okay.

[Squeak Stone] {00:12:11}
Alrighty. Take care. Happy New Year.

[Cliff Evan Katz] {00:12:14}
Happy New Year to you, too.

[Squeak Stone] {00:12:16}
Bye-bye.

[John Lien] {00:00:01}
Nope.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:03}
Hey, I'm not sure really what's happening. I feel like my phone keeps just cutting out. Do you know if it's on your end or my end?

[John Lien] {00:00:11}
I'm not sure.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:12}
Sorry about that.
Um, Cal State Folition is hiring a career advisor.
It's a Student Services Professional 2.
They're actually hiring 2 of them.

[John Lien] {00:00:28}
That's not one.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:30}
saw that one. Um…

[John Lien] {00:00:35}
Uh, could I prep you for… Like, do you remember? I tried…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:00:40}
Oh, right, cause it's a… You have to start at 1, right?

[John Lien] {00:00:47}
No, but… No.
But… I, I, I will submit my application.
Resmit, you know?
The last door and didn't open my app.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:03}
Oh, that's right.
Um, Cal State Fullerton actually has several positions.
that they've posted, and the application deadline is January 8th.
They also have a… Um, and many of them are, like, level 1, so there's… I don't know what… do you know what NAGPRA is?

[John Lien] {00:01:35}
No.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:01:36}
But they have a… Repatriation Project Specialist, which is an administrative analyst.
Then there's also a… Research Development Coordinator.
And that's a Level 1?
Come on.
Stop being so glitchy.
They also have a service center coordinator for student support.
Administrative Office Assistant.
Support 1?
I'd go to the… I'd go to their website. They… they've got a bunch that are open currently.
Yeah, definitely, I'm not gonna… you know the link, I don't need to send it to you, um, but… but check it out, because they do look like they have a number of positions that they're hiring for.
And I would be real… Specific about tailoring your materials to each… each job specifically.
Um…

[John Lien] {00:03:02}
Yes.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:03:05}
Let's see what else we can find… Yeah, I feel like they have more positions open than I've seen in a long time over there.

[John Lien] {00:03:19}
I would cook.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:03:22}
Cool.
um… Not seeing a whole lot else.
But again, it's still only, like, the… It's still just right after the new year. Most people are still out.

[John Lien] {00:03:54}
Um…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:03:56}
Should we just check in again next week? You've got… The first one that I sent you, And then the… And definitely take a look at Fullerton, you know, Cal State Fullerton, because they definitely have some posted.
Um, let me just check one other place.
Yeah, no, not much posted at all. Check another place.
Oh, there's also, um, we have a four-part mini-series of webinars for call center, um.
Like, how to… like, gateway to call centers, but… I would imagine it's also for remote work as well, not just like, in a physical call center. Um, does that interest you? It's a four-part series.

[John Lien] {00:06:35}
What time does it start?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:06:37}
It's an early start. It's four… it's Tuesday and Thursday, and then it misses a week, and then it's Tuesday and Thursday again, I think. And, um… It's probably a 7am start your time. I know that's really early.
Not ideal.

[John Lien] {00:07:00}
Sure.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:07:03}
Yeah, okay, I'll sign you up for it. Why… why is this being difficult? Why… I am so frustrated sometimes.
I just said I wanted to look at the jobs, and it didn't take me to the jobs.
Of all the fancy things that computers can do. It just baffles me that… Some things are so difficult sometimes.
Um.
Just bear with me.
Yeah, no, I think it's just a… Slow time of year right now for job posting.

[John Lien] {00:08:35}
and…

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:08:40}
Alright, well, you have a few to look at, and then we'll just check in next Friday. Does that work for you?

[John Lien] {00:08:48}
Yep.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:08:49}
Okay Well, it's good talking to you, and Happy New Year, and um… We'll chat next week.
Oh, and I'll sign you up for the course, and you'll get, um, a… An automated email with a link.

[John Lien] {00:09:05}
I could tune in via phone, right?

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:09:09}
Absolutely.

[John Lien] {00:09:11}
It goes.
The last time I went on the phone.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:09:15}
I do good.

[John Lien] {00:09:16}
I didn't get the presentation.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:09:21}
You should be able to, you have a smartphone, right?

[John Lien] {00:09:25}
Yeah.
Cool.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:09:29}
It should work.

[John Lien] {00:09:33}
Like, I call it, and… Uh, sorry.
Attending the workshops.
Indeed.
Difficult.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:09:50}
Yeah, hopefully this one won't give you any issue.

[John Lien] {00:09:56}
Well, I should put it on my computer.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:09:59}
I mean, if you can do it on your computer, you'd probably have a better experience of being able to See the slides and all of that.

[John Lien] {00:10:12}
But, yeah.
I'm just kind of, like, ignite right now.

[Kaitlin she/her/hers] {00:10:19}
So I, um… just sent you… so you should have… I just signed you up, so you should have that link in your email, um, along with the admin clerk position.
